# INTRODUCTION

Although in popular parlance "programming" means writing code on a computer, to a computer scientist, programming is a mathematical activity, with or without a computer. In the recent past, most programmers were mathematically sophisticated computer scientists who also wrote code. But today, the majority of coders in the IT industry are not computer scientists; they write code to automate business processes, relying exclusively on coding skills and without resort to mathematics. They refer to themselves as "developers". Developers are focused on the difficult problem of implementing efficient, maintainable, industrial applications that run the modern society. Computer scientists, too, are concerned with such important, practical matters, but, additionally, they are keen on broader, deeper, theoretical issues like accuracy, precision, efficiency, computability, and proof. However, the industry in general is not interested in such theoretical concerns, because for several decades, line-of-business systems have traditionally been built with reliance on business operations knowledge and system implementation skills, only. From the pragmatic perspective of the industry, if a system works in practice and is making money, there is no need for theoretical justifications.

Thus, the *threshold question* a young person must ask himself is whether if he is interested in making a living as a developer or if he is keen on pursuing a career as a computer scientist. What is the difference between the two? By way of analogy, a developer is to a computer scientist a carpenter is to a civil engineer. Like all analogies, this, too, is imperfect, but it does serve to highlight the differences.

He who wishes to learn to build chicken coops needs only take up carpentry, and he may immediately begin toiling with tools and materials of his trade, picking up necessary new skills while he works. But he who aspires to design and build slightly larger structures—like skyscrapers and bridges—must study civil engineering for several years, pencil and paper being his primary tool and material. A carpenter needs to know only woodworking. But an engineer must know properties of myriad construction materials, advanced mathematics, structural design, fluid dynamics, process management, supply chain management, project management, personnel management, and government regulations. That is, a carpenter must know only certain specialised practical skills, but the engineer must possess broad base of theoretical knowledge.

Similarly, a developer is expected to know all the pernicious quirks of the programming language he uses and is expected to acquaint himself with the peculiarities of the [application programming interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) (API) he uses. But even a highly experienced developer will not be tasked to design a new, original cipher that is faster and more secure than all the existing ones. On the other hand, a computer scientist specialising in machine learning is expected to design a new, more accurate algorithm, prove its correctness and efficiency, and implement a prototype, but he is not required to know how to write the most efficient production-quality code on a specific platform.

But the reality does not always match expectations. Although a newly minted civil engineer will never be required to apprentice under a carpenter, most young CS graduates must enter the IT industry as junior developers. Today, only a few unusually talented ones go on to design large, complex, life-critical systems; the majority are never given the opportunity to employ their CS knowledge. That is, they live out their technical careers as developers and subsequently transition into management. But they may get the second chance, when, and if, they rise to senior technical management—CIO, CTO, or VP. In these key positions, one gets to use his CS knowledge in directing the development efforts, albeit from afar, without being hands-on.

# ACADEMIA

????

## *sponsored graduate student*

Usually, high-achieving CS undergraduates go on to graduate school, where many advanced, theoretical courses are taught. But some CS graduate students are from other STEM fields, and some even from liberal arts. Quite a number of CS graduate students are part-timers who work full-time in the IT industry. Some graduate students teach introductory undergraduate courses as part-time instructors, which is a great way to gain teaching experience. Other graduate students focus on research, working as research assistants to professors. They work on the professors' funded projects, designing algorithms, implementing them, and publishing scientific papers on various subjects. This is how future CS researchers are train.

## *sponsored researcher*

After earning their PhD, the graduates go off to some other university and become associate (junior) professors. Others join research programmes elsewhere, as post-doctorates. It is an unwritten rule in academia that a graduate must leave his alma mater and join a different group with a different intellectual tradition, thus diversifying and strengthening numerous academic bloodlines.

## *full professor*

Everyone in academia is a teacher. Even those with strong research preference have to teach. A teacher reaches the pinacle of his career, when he is appointed a full professorship at a university. The other path to a professorship is to do great work in the industry at companies with strong academic cultures, then join academia in later career. Many a Bell Labs alumna has taken this route.

# INDUSTRY

????

## *system administrator*

Until recently, system maintenance was a major cost of IT operations. Armies of system administrators were needed to keep a large data centre in good order. The administrators are constantly busy, monitoring services, maintaining aging hardware, and repairing damaged components. With the advant of cloud services with their automated provisioning and monitoring, most private and public sector organisations are able to avoid hardware ownership and its incidental costs—data centre, backup site, administration staff, training, preparedness, and so forth. The work that system administrators used to perform have now been either automated away or are now performed by the software development team (devops team). The primary employers of system administrators today are large, cloud service providers, and due to the growth in this area, system administrators continue to be in demand. A CS degree is not necessary to be a competent system administrator.

## *business application developer*

Another high-demand role is line-of-business coder, the job the public thinks everyone in IT holds. Over the past decade, JavaScript and its Node runtime environment took the business software sector by storm. JavaScript—despite its well-known faults—is a simple language that novices can learn quickly. The Node ecosystem has ready-made tools for every imagined need, some are trivial, others substantial. And more importantly, JavaScript applications can run on servers, web browsers, desktop, or mobile devices. Companies can now have one development team and one code base for all these environments, thus saving costs. These characteristics make JavaScript the most popular software development platform in the history of business computing. Moreover, JavaScript web applications have become the mainstay of line-of-business software, because the web technologies are simple to learn, they are ubiquitous, they are largely standardised, and they are easy to maintain. These capabilities are absent in traditional software development technologies. Hence, there are tonnes of junior JavaScript web developer jobs available at present, and this trend will continue to grow, at least for the near future. Most coders do not possess a CS degree; they typically enter the industry either by self-study or via coding camps.

## *system programmer*

The less visible software work, though no less substantial, occurs off the web: scientific and parallel computing; embedded systems; satellites and communications; radar and digital signal processing; military command-and-control; air traffic control; avionics, automotive, and appliance firmware; transportation logistics; real-time trading systems; artificial intelligence; medical devices; 3D games and simulators; compilers; the list is endless. Most programmers who work in these roles have STEM education, and many with degrees in CS. Unlike line-of-business software, even the entry-level jobs in these application areas require substantial theoretical knowledge. Perhaps this is why much fewer number of IT entrants take these roles. But these jobs pay much better and they are also far more rewarding for the inquiring mind, because a lion's share of technical innovations occur in these specialities. And given the nature and importance of these areas, much greater amounts of funds are invested therein, compared to web development. But the price of entry—that is, education, knowledge, skills—into these specialities is commensurately higher.

## *technical manager*

Every STEMer eventually rises to a technical leadership position. Engineers become engineering managers. Scientists become principal scientists. Mathematicians become department chairs. Programmers become lead technologists. Leadership positions in any industry require knowledge, experience, skills, creativity, vision, ethics, and business accumen. A long, productive career endows a STEMer with knwoledge, experience, and skills. Inner drive inspires creativity and vision in him. His innate nature informs his professional ethics. But business accumen does not come naturally to someone in STEM. Some manage to pick up business skills along the way, but most do not have the opportunities. As such, many mid-career STEMers study part-time for the MBA, in preparation for a leadership role in the future.

# CAREER ADVICE

Today's technology industry, and by extension world economy, is powered by the hardwork of millions of developers. They have created, and are continuing to create, e-commerce sites, process automation systems, social media sites, and countless other useful systems. Indeed, the software industry runs on the back of hardworking developers. And most developers do not have a background in STEM.

A fair question therefore is whether a CS degree is useless in the IT industry. The answer is no. Many computer scientists work as developers in the industry, today. Although most of them would never have the opportunity to design a famous algorithm, they do create software that animate world economy. Their work is no less important than the computer scientists in academia. And the micro-decisions they make in their daily work is undoubtedly guided by the CS theory they absorbed in college. When they eventually rise to leadership positions, their macro-decisions will continue to be informed by their educational background.

## *workplace politics*

Like other industries, IT has every imaginable type of workplace politics. But one type of politics unique to IT is the akwardness and the unpleasant that often arise when business-focused management are placed in charge of technologists. Technologists must work for managers who neither know what they do, nor care how it is done, so long as it is done ahead of time and under budget. This management structure is endemic to small coding houses and services firms. This management practice is baked into the corporate culture of these small firms. In IT, businessmen are the ones who start small companies that create line-of-business applications under commercial contracts or perform run-of-the-mill services under government contracts. Driving force in these firms is contract performance, not technical innovation. Given the nature of the work and the small market share, profit margins of these firms are almost non-existent, and they exist contract-to-contract. The task of lining up the next contract, therefore, looms large on their collective minds. So, the managers are focused primarily on making the next sale. Naturally, they admire, trust, hire, and promote only their own kind. Most of the job opennings in IT are in small- to medium-sized business organisations. So, for many developers, this is their lot in life.

Academia, too, has its share of politics fuelled by rivalries. Intellectual rivalry and competitive spirit are good; they breed creativity and promote innovation. One of the best known [academic rivalries](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/07/the-jaguar-and-the-fox/378264/) was between two giants of modern physics, [Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) and [Gell-Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann), at Caltech. But academic politics is different in kind than the corporate variety. Corporate world is mobile; when politics grow particularly poisonous, a person can leave one company and join another in a sideway move. But a tenured professor is appointed for life, and if he flees to another institution, he loses his tenure and seniority. Squabbling professors are thus stuck with one another, essentially for life. As such, the potency of academic politics intensifies with time. Famous CS professors can escape, as many have done, to the corporate world, where a couple of additional zeros have been known to pop up on their pay cheques.
