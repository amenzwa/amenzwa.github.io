# INTRODUCTION

Many IT practitioners today assert that modern AI has obsoleted digital signal processing (DSP) techniques that the electrical engineers (EEs) have been using for about seven decades. They point to how CNNs can automatically extract features from an image, without any human guidance. This kind of argument springs from a misunderstanding of what DSP is and what "features" are. Indeed, far from being outmoded, DSP is now indispensable in all engineering fields. In this article, I, as an EE, explain DSP to IT practitioners, so that they may come to understand the essence and the utility of DSP and its continued necessity in all things STEM, today.
