# INTRODUCTION

Many IT practitioners today assert that modern AI has obsoleted digital signal processing (DSP) techniques that the electrical engineers (EEs) have been using for many decades. They point to how convolutional deep learning neural networks (CNNs) can automatically extract features from an image, without any human guidance. This kind of argument springs from a misunderstanding of what DSP is and what "features" are. Indeed, far from being outmoded, DSP is now indispensable in all STEM fields. In this article, I, as an EE, explain DSP to IT practitioners, so that they may come to understand the essence and the utility and the necessity of DSP in not just STEM but in the modern, technological society.
