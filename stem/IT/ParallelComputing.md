# CONCLUSION

asdf

A mechanical engineer may kill a user when his ill designed tool explodes. A civil engineer may kill tens of commuters when his poorly designed bridge collapses during rush hour. An aerospace engineer may kill hundreds of passengers when his badly designed wing falls off an airplane in flight. These licensed professionals suffer the consequences of their malpractice. But programmers do not.
