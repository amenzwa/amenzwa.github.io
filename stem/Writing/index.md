In this section, I present topics related to technical writing in general, and more specifically in STEM.

- [Writing STEM Papers using Jupyter](WritingSTEM.md)
  - This article describes proper ways to read and write STEM text, and how to use the right tools when reading and writing collaboratively. It is written for high school and undergraduate STEM students.
- [Entering Mathematical Symbols on macOS](MathsSymbols.md)
  - This article describes how to use macOS's built-in shortcuts to enter mathematical symbols in word processing documents and social media posts.
