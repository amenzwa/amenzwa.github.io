title: "The Computer Science Discipline"
---

In this section, I describe the computer science (CS) discipline from academic and industrial perspectives.

- [Computer Science Curriculum](Curriculum.md)
  - This article gives an overview of the computer science curriculum. It is aimed primarily at parents and counsellors advising a graduating high-schooler. The secondary audience is the high-schooler who is contemplating a career as a computer scientist.
- [Computer Science Career](Career.md)
  - This article gives guidance on careers in computer science. The intended audience is computer science undergraduate and graduate students.
- [*clrs*: Implementations and Commentaries of Algorithms in Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/amenzwa/clrs)
  - This project implements some of the interesting algorithms (mostly graphs) described in the textbook [*Introduction to Algorithms*](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X) (4ed 2022) by Professors Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (CLRS 4ed). The Python programmes and the associated explanations are presented as [Jupyter](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-fourth-Thomas-Cormen/dp/026204630X) notebook interactive documents. The intended audience is computer science undergraduate students taking a course on algorithms and IT practitioners interested in learning algorithm design, analysis, and implementation.
- [*pfd*: Purely Functional Data Structures in Elm Programming Language](https://github.com/amenzwa/clrs)
  - This project reimplements in Elm the data structures presented in the book [*Purely Functional Data Structures*](https://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Data-Structures-Okasaki/dp/0521663504) by Professor Okasaki (1999). Okasaki first published this material in 1996 in his [PhD dissertation](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/students/okasaki.pdf) at CMU. The book provides Standard ML and Haskell implementations. The target audience is the computer science undergraduate students studying functional programming.
