title: "History of Computing Devices"
---

In this section, I describe various computing devices: computers, calculators, slide rules.

- [How 8-bit Computers Work](HowComputersWork.md)
  - This article explains to software developers how 8-bit computers are built from subsystems, how these subsystems collaborate to perform simple calculations, and how such simple calculations when combined exhibit complex behaviours. This information may make *developers* more mechanically sympathetic programmers.
- [How RPN Calculators Work](HowRPNCalculatorsWork.md)
  - This article gives a high-level introduction to using HP reverse Polish notation (RPN), programmable, scientific calculators. The focus is on using the RPN input method and on writing programmes using the three supported means: RPN keystrokes, reverse Polish LISP (RPL), and Prime Programming Language (PPL). The target audience are high school and college *students* specialising in STEM.

- [How Slide Rules Work](HowSlideRulesWork.md)
  - This article provides a visual explanation of how one of the oldest computing devices, the slide rule, works, from the perspective of an engineering student who used it in college. It is written for *anyone* curious about what slide rules are, how they work, and how they were used.
