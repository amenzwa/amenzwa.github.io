title: "Topics in Artificial Intelligence"
---

This section explores artificial intelligence (AI) and its constituent topics, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL).

- [How AI Works](HowAIWorks.md)
  - This article gives a high-level explanation of AI. Given the nature of the subject, it contain bits of linear algebra and partial differential equations. But since this article is intended for everyone, STEMers and non-STEMers, every mathematical reference is accompanied by a plain English explanation.
- [*nn*: A Simple Neural Network Implementation in C](https://github.com/amenzwa/nn)
  - This project contains simple implementations of two well-known neural network algorithms: [David Rumelhart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rumelhart)'s error back-propagation (EBP) supervised learning algorithm and [Teuvo Kohonen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teuvo_Kohonen)'s self-organising map (SOM) unsupervised learning algorithm.
