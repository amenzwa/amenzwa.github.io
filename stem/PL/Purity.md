# INTRODUCTION

Physically, programming is just automation. But intellectually, it is much more: transformation, mathematics, logic, philosophy. In this article, I shall endeavour to describe the somewhat ambiguous boundary between philosophy and practicality—programming paradigms.

Programming paradigms are neither purely theoretical nor purely practical. I shall discuss the object-oriented (OO) paradigm from the perspective of Smalltalk and the functional programming (FP) paradigm from the perspective of Haskell. The focus here is on their paradigmatic purity.

Purity is a double-edged weapon. In the hands of an expert, purity yields stylish, succinct, simple solutions. But for a novice, purity offers numerous challenges. My goal here is to explain the philosophies of OO and FP, so that you may absorb and apply them in your own work. Although I provide a few concrete examples in Smalltalk and Haskell to clarify abstract concepts, the main thrust of this article is the philosophy.

# OBJECTIVE

all things are objects, including classes; classes are instances of meta classes

computation is accomplished by objects sending messages to other objects

# FUNCTIONAL

all things are functions—functions are both expressions and data

computation is accomplished when functions are applied to expressions and data

currying

combinators
