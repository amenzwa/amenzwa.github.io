title: "Playing the Akai EWI USB"

This [book](https://www.amazon.com/Playing-Akai-Electronic-Instrument-2015-10-16-ebook/dp/B00WNBY3AW/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=amen+zwa&qid=1637678225&sr=8-1) is for the musicians who are interested in electronic wind instruments in general and the Akai EWI USB in particular. It explains the functions of the EWIâ€™s various sensors, hardware configuration parameters, MIDI controller functions, Aria software synthesiser features, and external connections. And it describes the similarities and the differences between the EWI and the traditional wind instruments. But this book is not meant to replace the official Akai publications. It is also not a tips-and-tricks book that teaches you how to make fancy balloon animals out of the EWI, and it is not an instruction book that teaches you music theory fundamentals. It is focused on the technical information about the EWI, the sort of information not found in the official manuals, the sort of information you can use to decide whether the EWI is right for you if you have not already purchased one, the sort of information you can use to explore the numerous musical possibilities if you did purchase one.

I discuss the similarities and differences between traditional wind instruments and electronic wind instruments in the *Introduction* chapter. I also give an overview of the electronic wind instrument brands.

Next, I provide the technical details about the instrument in the chapter *EWI USB*. There, I describe the sensors, hardware configuration parameters, MIDI controller functions, Aria software synthesiser features, and external connections, and the maintenance tips.

In the *Playing* chapter, I provide detailed fingering charts for the full range of each instrument the EWI supports: the flute, the saxophone, the oboe, and the trumpet. Then, I explain playing and experimentation techniques for the EWI.

And in the *Add-Ons* chapter, I give a brief introduction to various hardware and software that you can use with the EWI. These include external audio equipment, external synthesisers, live loopers, and digital audio workstations (DAWs).
