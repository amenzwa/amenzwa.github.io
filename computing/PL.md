title: "Programming Languages and Paradigms"
---

In this section, I present various programming languages and the programming paradigms to which they belong. I selected these programming languages based not only on their commercial success but also on their intellectual influence.

- [Programming Languages](ProgrammingLanguages.md)
  - This article provides a high-level view of the world of programming languages. It gives an overview of the history of programming languages; describes the declarative and imperative family lines; gives guidance on which languages to study, and what books to read; and explains the nature of programming as an activity. It is written for all STEM *practitioners*: mathematicians, engineers, scientists, programmers, system administrators, and technical managers.
- [Programming Paradigms](ProgrammingParadigms.md)
  - This article provides a high-level view of programming paradigms. It is not a programming tutorial. It is a guide for *experienced* programmers on how to learn the four popular paradigms—procedural, objective, functional, and relational—highlighting the key concepts in each paradigm.
