# INTRODUCTION

The survival of our species owes much to our brain, specifically, its ability to observe, analyse, and plan. Planting crops and storing grains for the winter were some of the earliest uses of these abilities. Measuring and calculation are foundational elements of observation, analysis, and planning. Computation, upon which our modern society depends, is but an extension of those ancient measurement and calculation techniques.

Calculations operate on operands obtained through measurements. Counting is the oldest form of measurement. In prehistory, humans counted by scratching marks on bones. Next to evolve is a ruler etched with markings. Not long after, humans were marking, measuring, calculating, tracking, and predicting the movements of the sun and the moon using stone pillars, astronomically aligned burial mounds, and sun dials.

By around 3000 BC, Sumerians had invented the sexagesimal (base-$60$) number system, and they were using the [abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus) by 2700 BC. Egyptians used simple measuring instruments and advanced geometry to survey property boundaries on the Nile flood planes and to erect the pyramids. By 220 BC, Persian astronomers were using the [astrolabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolabe) to calculate the latitude, to measure the height of objects, and to triangulate positions. Greeks constructed truly advanced mechanical instruments that predicted solar and lunar eclipses. The complexity and refinement exhibited by the [Antikythera mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism) from around 200 BC continues to amaze modern engineers.

It could be said that astronomy evolved from measuring, tracking, and predicting the movements of the sun and the moon. When celestial navigation came to be used extensively during the 1500s during the age of global trade across the oceans, we began charting the night sky in earnest. Astronomical calculations involved manually manipulating large numbers. These calculations were tedious and error-prone.

In 1617, the brilliant Scottish mathematician [John Napier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Napier) published his method of mechanising [lattice multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_multiplication). This method is known today as [Napier's bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napier%27s_bones). A few years earlier in 1614, Napier discovered [logarithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm). Perhaps it would be more appropriate to say Napier invented logarithms, for his discovery was motivated by his desire to simplify multiplication and division. Arithmetically, multiplication can be thought of as repeated additions, and division as repeated subtractions. Logarithmically, multiplication of two numbers can be reduced to addition of their logarithms, and division to subtraction thereof. Hence, multiplication and division of very large numbers can be reduced to straightforward addition and subtraction, with the aid of prepared logarithm and inverse logarithm tables.

In 1620, [Edmund Gunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Gunter), an English astronomer, used Napier's logarithms to create a calculating device we now call [Gunter's scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Gunter#Gunter's_scale). The etchings on this device were not linear like a simple ruler, but logarithmic. To multiply two numbers, the length representing the multiplicand is first marked out on the logarithmic scale using a divider and, from thence, the length representing the multiplier is similarly marked out, thereby obtaining the product, which is the sum of the two logarithmic lengths. This device was the precursor to the slide rule.

The first practical [slide rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule) was invented by [William Oughtred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Oughtred), an English mathematician, in 1622. Oughtred used two bits of wood graduated with Gunter's scale. In 1630, Oughtred fashioned a brass circular slide rule with two integrated pointers. This device was a significant improvement over Gunter's scale, in terms of practicality and usability. The photograph below shows a brass circular slide rule that is a contemporaneous clone of Oughtred's.

![Davenport Circular Slide Rule](figures/SlideRules/DavenportCircularSlideRule.jpg)

The earliest adopters of the slide rule were the 17th century astronomers, who used it to make fast calculations of arithmetic and trigonometric operations. But it was the 19th century engineers, the spearheaded of the industrial revolution, who propelled the slide rule technology forward. For about four centuries, the slide rule remained the preeminent calculating device. Buildings and bridges were designed by slide rule. Apollo astronauts carried the [Pickett N600-ES log-log duplex](https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_694174) petite slide rule for navigation and thruster-burn calculations. The [General Dynamics F-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon), a modern air-superiority fighter, was designed by slide rule. In the 1970s, school children all over the world, including me, were taught to use the slide rule and the logarithm book, along with penmanship and grammar.

The largest group of slide rule users, naturally, were engineers. But slide rules were used in all areas of human endeavour that required calculating: business, construction, manufacturing, medicine, and even photography. Obviously, bankers and accountants relied on the slide rule to perform numerical gymnastics. But construction sites and factory floors, too, used specialised versions of slide rules for mixing concrete, computing volumes, etc. Surveyors used the [stadia slide rule](http://www.rechenschieber.org/stadia.pdf) made specifically for the purpose. Doctors use special, [medical slide rules](https://www.rechenschieber-werbemittel.de/en/slide-charts/medical) for calculating all manner of things: body mass index, pregnancy terms, medicine dosage, and the like. Photographers used [photometric slide rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinograph) for calculating film development times. Army officers used [artillery slide rules](https://www.springfieldarsenal.net/155MM-Howitzer-slide-rule-range-tables-for-M483-M16.htm). Pilots used [aviation slide rules](https://www.sliderulemuseum.com/Aerospace.htm). The list was long. The slide rule perfectly expressed the engineering design philosophy: capability by simplicity.

But then, in 1972, HP released its first programmable scientific calculator, the inimitable [HP-35](https://hpmuseum.org/hp35.htm). The HP-35 rang loud the death knell of the slide rule. Although electronic pocket calculators were unaffordable in the early 1970s, thanks to [Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law), they became ubiquitous within a decade, and quickly displaced the slide rule. By the early 1980s, only a few people were using the slide rule. I was one.

## *personal background*

It was around this time that I arrived at the university—in [Burma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar). In those days, electronic pocket calculators were beyond the reach of most college students. To ensure fairness, [my engineering college](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon_Technological_University) insisted that all students used the government-issued slide rule, which was readily accessible to everyone. In those days, many classrooms in my college had large, wall-mounted [demonstration slide rules](https://sliderulemuseum.com/DemoSR.htm) to teach first-year students how properly to use the slide rule like an engineer—that is, to eradicate the bad habits learned in high school.

I subsequently emigrated to the US. Arrival in the US ended my association with the slide rule because, by the 1980s, American engineers were already using [HP RPN calculators](https://www.hpmuseum.org) and [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) technical computing software on the [IBM PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer). I soon became an HP calculator devotee. As such, I never got to use the slide rule extensively in a professional setting. But I hung on to my student slide rules: the government-issued Aristo 0968 Studio, a straight rule, and the handed-down Faber-Castell 8/10, a circular rule. To this day, I remain partial to the intimate, tactile nature of the slide rule, especially the demands it places upon the user's mind. Over the next four decades, I have collected numerous slide rules. Many models in my collection are the ones I coveted as an engineering student in Burma, but were well beyond my reach.

In its heyday, everyone uses the slide rule in every facet of life. As children, we saw it everywhere, so we were acquainted with it, even if we did not know how to use it. We were taught to use the slide rule's basic facilities in middle school. Our options were the abacus, the log books, or the slide rule. The choice was abundantly clear; we welcomed the opportunity to learn and to use the slide rule. Indeed, it was a rite of passage. Now, though, even the [brightest engineering students](https://youtu.be/CblhxhnSymg) in the world have never heard of a slide rule, let alone know what it is.

## *main goal*

My main goal in writing this article is to preserve the knowledge about, and the memory of, the slide rule: how it works and how it was used. The focus here is on the basic principles of operation and how the slide rule was used in engineering. This is a "how it works" explanation, and not a "how to use" manual. Those who are interested in the most efficient use of a slide rule may read the manuals listed in the resources section at the end of this article. Beyond history and reminiscence, I hope to highlight the wide-ranging utility of some of the most basic mathematical functions that are familiar to middle schoolers.

## *recommended devices*

It is impossible to discuss the slide rule without having the device in hand. For the presentations below, I chose the Keuffel & Esser (K&E) 4081-3 Log Log Duplex Decitrig. It was one of the most common engineering slide rules for decades and, as such, many engineering professors published good introductory books for it. Another common model was the Post 1460 Versalog. Although somewhat less popular than the K&E 4081-3, the Post 1460 is cheaper and, in my opinion, is a better slide rule. Go on eBay and buy an inexpensive one, either the [K&E 4081-3](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&_nkw=k%26e+4081-3+slide+rule&_sacat=0&LH_TitleDesc=0&_odkw=k%26e+4081-3+log+log+duplex+decitrig&_osacat=0) or the [Post 1460](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&_nkw=post+1460+versalog+slide+rule&_sacat=0); you will need a slide rule to follow the discussions below. Alternatively, you could use a [slide rule simulator](https://www.sliderules.org/react/hemmi_versalog_ii.html).

# PRINCIPLES

## *arithmetic operations*

***properties of  logarithms***—The base-$10$ common logarithm function $log_{10}(x)$ and its inverse power-of-10 function $10^x$ gives life to the slide rule. The two main properties of logarithms upon which the slide rule relies are these:
$$
a × b = log^{-1}[log(a) + log(b)] \\
a ÷ b = log^{-1}[log(a) - log(b)]
$$
That is, to compute $a × b$, we first compute the sum of $log(a)$ and $log(b)$, then compute the $log^{-1}$ of the sum. Likewise, $a ÷ b$ is computed as the $log^{-1}$ of the difference between $log(a)$ and $log(b)$. Note that $log^{-1}(x) = 10^x$.

***logarithmic scale***—The slide rule mechanised these calculations by using two identical logarithmic scales, commonly labelled $C$ (on the slide) and $D$ (on the frame). To derive the logarithmic scale, we begin with a 25-cm-long arithmetic scale divided into $10$ equal major divisions, marked $0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 10$, similar to an ordinary ruler. We then line up $log(1) = 0$ with the arithmetic scale's $0$, and place $log(2) = 0.301, log(3) = 0.477, ...$ at the appropriate spots along the arithmetic scale. The resulting graduations is the logarithmic scale. Incidentally, the arithmetic scale is the logarithm scale $L$, which is used to compute the $log$ function. The arithmetic $L$ scale and the logarithmic $D$ scales are shown below.

[$L$ scale and $D$ scale]

The $D$ and the $L$ scales are related by a bijective function $log$:
$$
log: D \rightarrow L \\
log^{-1}: L \rightarrow D
$$
In the plot below, the black curve is $log$ and the red is $log^{-1}$.

![log](./figures/SlideRules/plot-log.jpg)

The special name for $log^{-1}$ is $10^x$. The $D$ and the $L$ scales form a transform pair that converts between the  logarithmic scale and the arithmetic scale. To put it differently, the $log$ function transforms the arithmetic scale's $×$ and $÷$ operators into the logarithmic scale's $+$ and $-$ operators, and the $log^{-1}$ function performs the inverse transformation.

Naturally, plotting the $log$ function on a logarithmic scale produces a sequence of evenly spaced values. Hence, the $L$ scale appears linear, when laid out on the logarithmic slide rule. Note also that the mere act of reading $x$ on the logarithmic scale implicitly computes $log(x)$, and there is no need explicitly to compute $log^{-1}(x)$. Gunter's logarithmic scale, thus, was the groundbreaking idea that made the slide rule work so effectively, efficiently, effortlessly.

The logarithmic scale has many other uses in STEM beyond the slide rule: the [Richter scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale) used to measure seismic events; the $dB$ [decibel scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel) used to measure sound pressure levels; the [spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram) used to visualise frequency domain signals are just a few examples. These uses exploit the logarithmic scale's ability to compress a very large range, while preserving relevant details.

***computations using logarithmic scales***—To compute $log(2)$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:

1. $D$—Place the cursor hairline on the *argument* $2$ on the $D$ scale.
2. $L$—Read under the hairline the *result* $0.301$ on the $L$ scale. This computes $log(2) = 0.301$.

[$log(2)$ photo]

To compute $2 × 3$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:

1. $D$—Place the hairline on the *multiplicand* $2$ on the $D$ scale.
2. $C$—Slide the left-hand $1$ on the $C$ scale under the hairline.
3. $C$—Place the hairline on the *multiplier* $3$ on the $C$ scale.
4. $D$—Read under the hairline the *product* $6$ on the $D$ scale.

[$2 × 3$ photo]

The above multiplication procedure computes $2 × 3 = 6$, like this:

- In step (1), we placed the hairline on $D$ scale's $2$. In this way, we mechanically marked out the length $[1, 2]$ along the logarithmic $D$ scale. Mathematically, this is equivalent to computing $log(2)$.
- In step (2), we lined up $C$ scale's left-hand $1$, the beginning of the scale, with $D$ scale's $2$, in preparation for the next step.
- In step (3), we placed the hairline on $C$ scale's $3$. This mechanically marked out the length $[1, 2]_D + [1, 3]_C$ on the logarithmic $D$ scale, which is mathematically equivalent to computing $log(2) + log(3)$.
- Then, in step (4), we read the result $6$ on the $D$ scale under the hairline. This is a mathematical equivalent of computing $log^{-1}[log(2) + log(3)] = 2 × 3 = 6$.

To put it plainly, adding $2$ units of length and $3$ units of length yields $2 + 3 = 5$ units of length on the arithmetic scale. But on the logarithmic scale, adding $2$ units of length and $3$ units of length yields $2 × 3 = 6$ units of length.

To compute $2 ÷ 3$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:

1. $D$—Place the hairline on the *dividend* $2$ on the $D$ scale. This computes $log(2)$.
2. $C$—Slide under the hairline the *divisor* $3$ on the $C$ scale.
3. $C$—Place the hairline on the right-hand $1$ on the $C$ scale. This computes $log(2) - log(3)$.
4. $D$—Read under the hairline the *quotient* $667$ on the $D$ scale, which is interpreted to be $0.667$, as will be explained below. This computes $log^{-1}[log(2) - log(3)] = 2 ÷ 3 = 0.667$.

[$2 ÷ 3$ photo]

Multiplication and division operations start and end with the cursor hairline on the $D$ scale. Skilled users frequently skipped the initial cursor setting when multiplying and the final cursor setting when dividing, opting instead to use the either end of the $C$ scale as the substitute hairline. By the way, the slide rule is always operated using both hands. To make fine adjustments of the slider, one uses the index fingers of both hands, one finger pushing and the other opposing. The bottom end of the cursor glides along the bottom of the lower frame, and there is a tension spring between the top end of the cursor and the top of the upper frame. This spring stabilises the cursor against the frame. To make fine adjustments of the cursor, one uses the thumbs of both hands against the bottom of the cursor. But when using the back side of a duplex straight rule, the cursor had to be fine adjusted using the index fingers, since the flat bottom of the cursor has now flipped to the top.

After the invention of the slide rule's logarithmic scale and its basic mechanisms in the early 17th century, other scales were added to the device in quick succession. Slide rules steadily grew larger and more complex over the centuries.

## *accuracy and precision*

In slide rule parlance, *accuracy* refers to how consistently the device operates—that is, how well it was manufactured and how finely it was calibrated. And *precision* means how many significant figures the user can reliably read off the scale.

***accuracy***—More expensive, professional-grade slide rules were made exceedingly well, but they all allow the user to calibrate the device. Even a well-made slide rule, like the K&E 4081-3 Log Log Duplex Decitrig slide rule, shown below, can go out of alignment if mistreated, say by exposing it to shock, heat, or cold. And prolonged exposure to moisture can warp a wood slide rule, like the K&E 4081-3, thereby damaging it, permanently. I describe the recalibration procedure in the maintenance section, below. By the way, the term "Decitrig" was K&E's trade name for its slide rules that used decimal degrees, instead of minutes and seconds. Engineers prefer using the more convenient decimal notation. And the K&E 4081-3 was perhaps the most popular engineering slide rule in the US.

[K&E 4081-3 Log Log Duplex Decitrig]

***precision***—Before we discuss precision of slide rules, let us explore the nature of the logarithmic scale. The $C$ and $D$ scales are logarithmic, so they are nonlinear. The scales start at $log(1)$, which is marked as $1$, and end at $log(10)$, which is also marked as $1$. In other words, these scales wrap around by multiples of $10$. So, $3.14$ is read exactly the same as $0.314$, $31.4$, and $314$. The decimal point is located using some clever mental arithmetic.

As can be seen in the photograph below, the distance between two adjacent major divisions on the scale shrinks logarithmically from left to right:

- $log(2) - log(1) = 0.301 \approx 30\%$
- $log(3) - log(2) = 0.176 \approx 18\%$
- $log(4) - log(3) = 0.125 \approx 12\%$
- $log(5) - log(4) = 0.097 \approx 10\%$
- $log(6) - log(5) = 0.079 \approx 8\%$
- $log(7) - log(6) = 0.067 \approx 7\%$
- $log(8) - log(7) = 0.058 \approx 6\%$
- $log(9) - log(8) = 0.051 \approx 5\%$
- $log(10) - log(9) = 0.046 \approx 4\%$

[whole $D$ scale]

The photograph above also shows the three distinct regions on the $D$ scale that have different resolutions:

- In the range $[1, 2]$, the scale is graduated into $10$ major divisions, and each major division is further graduated into $10$ minor divisions.
- In the rage $[2, 5]$, the scale is graduated into $10$ major divisions, and each major division is further graduated into $5$ minor divisions.
- In the range $[5, 1]$, the scale is graduated into $10$ major divisions, and each major division is further graduated into $2$ minor divisions.

At the left end of the $D$ scale, $1.11$, $1.12$, etc., can be read directly from the scale. With practice, one could visually subdivide each minor division into $10$ sub-subdivisions and discern $1.111$ from $1.112$. In the photograph below, the cursor hairline is placed on $1.111$.

[$1.111$ on $D$ scale]

In the middle of the $D$ scale, $3.12$, $3.14$, etc., can be read directly from the scale. Indeed, $3.14$ is marked as $π$ on $C$ and $D$ scales of all slide rules. With a nominal eyesight, each minor division could be subdivided visually and easily read $3.13$, which is halfway between the $3.12$ and the $3.14$ graduations. The photograph below shows the hairline on $3.13$.

[$3.13$ on $D$ scale]

On the right end of $D$ scale, $9.8$, $8.85$, $9.9$, $9.95$, etc., can be read directly from the scale. With due care, each minor division could be subdivided into $2$ sub-subdivisions and read without undue strain $9.975$, which is halfway between the $9.95$ and the $1$ graduations. See the photograph below. But for those of us with poor eyesights, it is rather difficult to discern $9.98$ from $9.99$.

[$9.975$ on $D$ scale]

Under optimal conditions—calibrated slide rule, nominal eyesight, alert mind, and good lighting—the slide rule can attain four significant figures on the lower end of the $D$ scale and three significant figures on the higher end of the scale.

Ordinarily, the slide rule was used to evaluate complicated expressions involving many chained calculations needed to be performed quickly, but precision was not a paramount concern. Where precision is important, [logarithm tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_table) were used. These tables were laboriously hand-computed to several significant figures. If the desired value fell between two entries in the table, one could manually interpolate the result. While accountants may have demanded such high precisions afforded by the logarithm tables, engineers willingly accepted three or four significant figures offered by the slide rule, because the slide rule was accurate enough for engineering use and it was the fastest means then available to perform many calculations. In due course, the slide rule became inextricably linked to engineers, like the stethoscope to doctors.

# VARIETIES

Slide rules came in straight, circular, and cylindrical varieties. Cylindrical rules consist of two concentric cylinders that slide and rotate relative to each other. The key innovation of cylindrical rules is the helical scale that wraps round the cylinder. The coiled scale stretches to an impressive length, despite the relatively small size of the cylinder. Of course, a longer scale yields a greater precision. The cylinder can be rotated to bring the back-facing numbers round to the front.

Circular rules are the first practical slide rules. Their main advantages are compactness and stoutness. A typical model is constructed like a pocket watch and operated like one too, using crowns. The glass-faced, sealed construction protected the device against dust. Some circular models sport a spiral scale, thereby extracting good precision from a compact real estate. But because the markings encircle the centre, the device needed be rotated frequently to read the scale. And on some very small models, the graduation marks get very tight near the centre. In other words, circular scales can be rather fiddly.

Of all the varieties, straight rules are the easiest and the most convenient to use, because they are relatively small and light, and because the whole scale is readable at once. However, their scale lengths are bounded by the length of the body. So, straight rules are less precise by comparison.

Most engineers preferred straight rules, because these devices were accurate enough, portable, and easy to use, allowing very fast calculations. Indeed, given the focus of this article, much of the presentation here concerns straight rules. A few engineers used circular models, either because these devices were more precise or because they were more compact. No engineers in my day used cylindrical ones; these devices were too unwieldy and they had only basic arithmetic scales, albeit very long ones indeed. But accountants, financiers, actuaries, and others who require greater precision swore by cylindrical rules.

***straight rules***—The most common kind of slide rule was the 25 cm desk model, called the straight rule. The cursor is made of clear plastic or glass, etched with a hairline. The frame and the slide are made of wood, bamboo, aluminium, or plastic. The name "slide rule" derives from the slippy-slidy bits and the ruler-like scales.

The most basic straight rule is the *Mannheim* model, the progenitor of the modern slide rule. Surely, applying the adjective "modern" to a device that had been deemed outmoded for over 40 years is doing gentle violence to the English language. But given that the slide rule is now over 400 years old, a 150-year-old model is comparatively "modern".

A Mannheim slide rule has scales for arithmetic ($×$ and $÷$), logarithmic ($log_{10}$), square ($x^2$ and $\sqrt{x}$), cubic ($x^3$ and $\sqrt[3]{x}$), and trigonometric ($sin$, $tan$, $cos$, and $cot$). The following is the Post 1447 simplex slide rule, manufactured by the Japanese company Hemmi in the late 1950s. In this context, "simplex" refers to the slide rules with scales on only one side of the frame. All slides, however, have scales on both sides. As is common with Japanese slide rules, this one is made of bamboo, which is a far better material than wood, because bamboo is more resistant to warping and slides more smoothly.

[Post 1447]

The original Mannheim slide rule was invented in 1859 by [Amédée Mannheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amédée_Mannheim), a French artillery officer, for quickly computing artillery firing solutions in the field. It was capable of computing only $×$, $÷$, $x^2$, and $\sqrt{x}$, which suited its intended purpose.

A slight improvement upon the Mannheim slide rule was the German *Rietz* model. It added the $ST$ scale for small angles in the range $[0.573\degree, $ $5.73\degree$], or in radians $[0.01, 0.1]$. In this angular range, $sin(\theta) \approx tan(\theta)$, so the combined $sin$-$tan$ scale suffices—for engineers, that is. The following is the Nestler 23 R Rietz, a famous German slide rule known to be a favourite of Albert Einstein. The 23 R dates to 1907, but the example below is from the 1940s.

[Nestler 23 R]

Another German innovation, the *Darmstadt* model, was the workhorse preferred by the early 20th century engineers. It has three $LL$ scales, $LL_1$, $LL_2$, and $LL_3$, used to compute general exponentiation of the form $x^{y/z} = \sqrt[z]{x^y}$. When $z = 1$, the general expression reduces to $x^y$. When $y = 1$, the general expression reduces to $x^{1/z} = \sqrt[z]{x}$. Newer, more advanced models sport the fourth $LL_0$ scale. The following is the Aristo 967 U Darmstadt from the mid 1970s.

[Aristo 967 U]

All advanced engineering slide rules were based on the *log-log duplex* model. The term "duplex" refers to the fact that both sides of the frame are etched with scales. The earliest duplex rules date to the 1900s. The "log-log" term refers to the $LL$ scale. The models used by engineering students have three black $LL$ scales ($LL_1$, $LL_2$, and $LL_3$) for cases where $x > 1$ and three red $LL$ scales ($LL_{01}$, $LL_{02}$, and $LL_{03}$ running from right to left) for cases where $x < 1$. More advanced models used by professional engineers have four black-red pairs of $LL$ scales.

The Faber-Castell (FC) 2/83 N Novo Duplex slide rule, shown below, was a common model used by many engineers in the mid to late 1970s. It was especially popular outside the US. It was a big (wide) slide rule. And it was arguably one of the most aesthetically pleasing slid rules ever manufactured. Aside from sporting four black-red pairs of $LL$ scales, it had $T_1$ and $T_2$ refined $tan$ scales, $W_1$ and $W_2$ specialised scale pairs for computing $\sqrt{x}$ with greater precision, and additional hairlines on the cursor for power (HP and kW) computations.

[Faber-Castell 2/83 N Novo Duplex]

Of the straight rule varieties, the less expensive Mannheim and Rietz models were used in high school, and the more sophisticated Darmstadt and log-log duplex models were used in college. There were longer straight rules used by those who require more precision. Some models even came with magnifying cursor glass to allow a more precise reading. And there were shorter, pocket-sized straight rules, like the Pickett N600-ES carried by the Apollo astronauts. Although not very precise, pocket slide rules were good enough for back-of-the-napkin calculations in the field. Engineers, however, were partial to the 25 cm desk straight rule. As such, most slide rules manufactured over the past two centuries were of this design.

***circular rules***—As an engineering student in the 1980s in Burma, I used the Faber-Castell 8/10 circular slide rule, shown below, which was a hand-me-down from my engineer aunt. All my classmates used the government-issued Aristo 0968 straight slide rule. All the scales are etched onto the exposed plastic face. The outer portion of the face is fixed to the body, and the inner portion of the face rotates. And the cursor with the hairline rotates across the scales on the face. The FC 8/10, despite being circular, operates on the same principles as the straight rule: the outer portion of the FC 8/10 is analogous to the frame of the straight rule, the inner portion to the slide. The circular shape of the device does indeed highlight, visually and literally, the wrap-around nature of the logarithmic scales.

[Faber-Castell 8/10, early 1970s]

The diameter of the FC 8/10 circular rule is only 12 cm, but in terms of capability, it is equivalent to a 25-cm Rietz straight rule. I liked the FC 8/10, because it was well made like all FC products, accurate, inexpensive, unique, aesthetically pleasing, and compact. I used it for ordinary, daily tasks. But when I needed the $LL$ scale, say for laboratory work and examinations, I used the Aristo 0968 log-log duplex. In general, switching slide rules like this is detrimental, since it robs the opportunity to develop an intimate relation with a single device. But the FC 8/10 is an atypical circular rule; in fact, it is a wrap-around Mannheim straight rule. So, my switching between the FC 8/10 and the 0968 did not impact me, negatively. By way of analogy, FC 8/10 is to Aristo 0968 what [HP-35](https://hpmuseum.org/hp35.htm) is to [HP-32S](https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp32s.htm).

A more typical design for circular slide rules is the pocket watch variety, like the Fowler Universal Calculator shown below. Fowler began manufacturing calculating devices in the mid 1800s. This particular model probably dates to the 1950s. Etched into the glass of this Fowler is the fixed red hairline, aligned with the crown at 12 o'clock. This crown rotates the face anticlockwise. All the scales are etched onto this one-piece, rotating face. And the crown at 2 o'clock rotates the clear plastic cursor bearing the black hairline clockwise.

[Fowler Universal Calculator, 1854, prob 1950s]

As I said before, most engineers of the day shunned the circular slide rule. But the Dempster RotaRule Model AA was the one circular rule that could have temped even the most ardent straight rule enthusiast. The RotaRule is a duplex model, somewhat uncommon trait among circular rules, was the brainchild of [John Dempster](http://oughtred.org/jos/Davis_DempsterRotaRule.pdf), a mechanical engineer. And in addition to the usual assortment of scales, it has the scales that engineers need: three $LL$ scales, scales for computing $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. At about 13 cm in diameter, the RotaRule is about the same size as the FC 8/10. But unlike the FC 8/10's 25 cm circumference circular scale, the RotaRule has a 127-cm spiral $C$ and $D$ scales plus a 254-cm four-cycle $LL$ scale. And it even has a $Monthly\ Interest$ scale, making it suitable to both technical and business uses. Because the outer portion of the disc (analogue of straight rule's frame) is fixed and the inner portion (analogue of straight rule's slide) rotates, the RotaRule needs only one cursor. And this cursor is well made to the point of being over engineered: it has a sturdy frame equipped with a friction lock, and its central hub has hole to plant a small, brass-framed magnifier that comes with the device. Dempster began manufacturing the RotaRule in 1928. The RutaRule AA model shown below is probably from the late 1940s.

[Dempster RotaRule AA, 1928, prob 1940s]

It is no secret that most engineers frown upon the circular slide rule. [Seymour Cray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Cray), my favourite electrical engineer and a fellow circular slide rule fancier, [once quipped](https://youtu.be/8Z9VStbhplQ?t=713), "If you had a circular [slide rule], you had some social problems in college." He was right.

***cylindrical rules***—All cylindrical rules employed the very long helical scale, and the business community favours the greater precision these devices afforded. As such, most cylindrical rules very large; they were meant for the banker's desk. By contrast, the Otis King Model L, shown below, is a very compact cylindrical rule. In the stowed position, the device is well shy of the length of an open hand. It fitted coat pockets as well as any watch-style circular models, but it offered far greater precision. This particular Model L is likely from the early 1970s.

[Otis King Model L, 1922, early 1970s]

To use the Otis King, one holds the chrome handle in the left hand, and pulls out the top, thereby exposing the helical logarithmic scales. The Model L shown above has the $C$ scale on the top, the $L$ scale in the middle, and the $D$ scale on the bottom. The black handle, which is operated with the right hand, is the equivalent of the straight rule's cursor, and it is engraved with two white index marks. These two indices are the equivalents of the two hairlines on the Fowler circular rule. The upper portion of the device which holds the $C$ and $L$ scales can shift up and down along the longitudinal axis and can also spin about the axis, independently of the fixed $D$ scale on the lower portion. Of course, the hidden numbers on the $D$ scale can be brought forward by spinning the handle in the left hand. And the black cursor can shift and spin independently of both scales. Thus, the Model L's  fixed lower portion is like the frame of the straight rule, the movable upper portion is like the slide of the straight rule.

One of the giants of cylindrical rules was the [K&E 1740 Thacher](https://www.si.edu/object/keuffel-esser-1740-thacher-cylindrical-slide-rule:nmah_1131289), designed by [Edwin Thacher](https://www.si.edu/spotlight/slide-rules/cylindrical-slide-rules) in 1881. I have never seen one in person, so I do not know the finer points of how it was used. The [general operating principles](https://youtu.be/EsDCXxn4Fpk?t=68) are similar to that of the Otis King Model K: the outer cylinder is fixed to the frame but it can spin in place. The inner cylinder shifts and spins independently of the outer cylinder. Thus, the outer cylinder is analogous to the straight rule's frame, and the inner cylinder is analogous to the straight rule's slide. The is, however, no cursor or pointer on this device. The first Thacher model dates to 1881. The one shown in the photograph blow, a museum piece, is probably a late model from the 1950s, by the look of it.

# OPERATIONS

A typical engineering slide rule—of the 1970s vintage—supported arithmetic, logarithmic, exponential, and trigonometric functions. Some advanced models supported hyperbolic functions. More specialised models had field-specific functions: electronic, electrical, mechanical, chemical, civil, and so forth. Here, I shall ignore the field-specific functions, and instead describe the common engineering slide rule functions.

## *arithmetic*

The driving force behind the slide rule was to expedite $×$ and $÷$. As such, slide rule designers had invented numerous scales to augment the logarithmic $C$ and $D$ scales: reciprocal $CI$ and $DI$; folded $CF$ and $DF$; and folded reciprocal $CIF$ and $DIF$.

In 1775, [Thomas Everard](https://www.si.edu/object/nmah_1127892), an English excise officer, inverted the logarithmic scale, thus paving the way for the reciprocal $CI$ and $DI$ scales that run from right to left. Using $D$ and $C$, $a ÷ b$ is computed as $a_D - b_C$, but using $D$ and $CI$ this expression is computed as $a_D + b_{CI}$:
$$
a ÷ b = log(a) - log(b) = log(a) + log(-b)
$$
The $CF$, $DF$, $CIF$, and $DIF$ scales are called "folded", because they fold the $C$, $D$, $CI$, and $DI$ scales, respectively, at $π$, thereby moving the $1$ mark to the middle of the scale. The following photograph shows these auxiliary arithmetic scales.

[reciprocal and folded scales photo]

These auxiliary scales allow faster calculations, when many $×$ and $÷$ operations are chained in a complicated expression. For example, a folded $CI$ has the $1$ mark near the middle of the slide rule, so the cursor movement distance could be reduce considerably. But I shall not present the detailed procedures on using these scales, because they are procedural optimisations not essential to understanding the fundamentals of the slide rule. Interested readers may refer to the manuals for specific slide rules, which are listed in the resource section, below.

## *logarithmic*

The logarithmic scale is the irony of the slide rule. The $log$ function is nonlinear. But since the slide rule is built upon this same nonlinear scale, the $L$ scale appears linear on the slide rule. To compute a logarithm, say $log(2)$, one simply places the hairline on the $2$ mark on the $D$ logarithmic scale, and read the result on the $L$ arithmetic scale. See below.

[$log(2)$ photo]

## *exponentiation*

***logarithmic exponentiation***—The general exponentiation $x^{y/z}$ can be reduced to arithmetic operations by applying the $log$ function:
$$
log(x^{y/z}) = y ÷ z × log(x)
$$
Then, $×$ and $÷$ can be further reduced to $+$ and $-$ by applying the $log$ function once more:
$$
log(y ÷ z × log(x)) = log(y) - log(z) + log(log(x))
$$
It turns out that the slide rule uses the base-$e$ natural logarithm $ln$ as the inner logarithm, and the base-$10$ common logarithm $log$ as the outer logarithm. That is, the function composition is actually $log \circ ln$. The $ln$ is used instead of the $log$ for the inner logarithm, in order to compress the range of the $LL_n$ scale, thereby improving the precision. Hence, computing $x^{y/z}$ on the slide rule is equivalent to performing these logarithmic operations:
$$
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    x^{y/z} & = ln^{-1}(y ÷ z × ln(x)) \\
            & = ln^{-1}[log^{-1}\{log(y ÷ z × ln(x))\}] \\
            & = ln^{-1}[log^{-1}\{log(y) - log(z) + log(ln(x))\}]
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
$$
So, computing $2^4$ and $\sqrt[4]{16}$ on the slide rule proceed as follows:
- $2^4 = 2^{4/1} = ln^{-1}[4 ÷ 1 × ln(2)] = ln^{-1}[log^{-1}\{log(4) - log(1) + log(ln(2))\}] = 16$
- $\sqrt[4]{16} = 16^{1/4} = ln^{-1}[1 ÷ 4 × ln(16)] = ln^{-1}[log^{-1}\{log(1) - log(4) + log(ln(16))\}] = 2$

We now see that the "log-log" nomenclature of engineering slide rules is a not-so-subtle nod to the function composition $log \circ ln$ that appears in the expressions computing $x^{y/z}$.

***squaring on slide rule***—A typical engineering slide rule provides the $A$ scale on the frame and the $B$ scale on the slide for computing $x^2$, the $K$ scale on the frame for computing $x^3$, and the $LL_n$ scales and their reciprocals $LL_{0n}$ scales on the frame for computing $x^y$. The procedures for computing powers and roots always involve the $D$ scale.

To compute $3^2$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:

- $D$—Place the hairline on the *argument* $3$ on the $D$ scale.
- $A$—Read under the hairline the *result* $9$ on the $A$ scale. This computes $3^2 = 9$.

[$3^2$ photo]

The $A$-$D$ scale pair computes $x^2$ because $A$ is a dual-cycle logarithmic scale and $D$ is a single-cycle logarithmic scale. In the reverse direction, the $D$-$A$ scale pair computes $\sqrt{x}$.

To compute $\sqrt{9}$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:

- $A$—Place the hairline on the *argument* $9$ in the first cycle of the $A$ scale.
- $D$—Read under the hairline the result $3$ on the $D$ scale. This computes $\sqrt{9} = 3$.

Placing the hairline on $9$ in the second cycle of the $A$ scale would compute $\sqrt{90} = 9.49$. 

***cubing on slide rule***—It is a little known fact that [Isaac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton) invented the cubic $K$ scale in 1675 by solving the cubic equations using three consecutive logarithmic scales. The $K$-$D$ scale pair computes $x^3$ because $K$ is a triple-cycle logarithmic scale. And the reverse $D$-$K$ scale pair computes $\sqrt[3]{x}$.

To compute $3^3$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:

- $D$—Place the hairline on the *argument* $3$ on the $D$ scale.
- $K$—Read under the hairline the *result* $27$ on the second cycle of the $K$ scale. This computes $3^3 = 27$.

When computing $\sqrt[3]{x}$, the digits to the left of the decimal are grouped by threes, and if the left-most group has one digit (say $1,000$) then place the argument in $K$ scale's first cycle; if two digits (say $22,000$) then in the second cycle; and if three digits (say $333,000$) then in the third cycle.

To compute $\sqrt[3]{64000}$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:

- $K$—Place the hairline on the *argument* $64$ in the second cycle of the $K$ scale.
- $D$—Read under the hairline the *result* $4$ on the $D$ scale. A quick mental calculation $\sqrt[3]{1000} = 10$ indicates that the result should be in the tens, so the actual result is $40$. This computes $\sqrt[3]{64000} = 40$. 

[$\sqrt[3]{64000}$ photo]

Placing the hairline on $6.4$ in the first cycle of the $K$ scale would compute $\sqrt[3]{6.4} = 1.857$, and placing the hairline on $640$ on the third cycle of the $K$ scale would compute $\sqrt[3]{640} = 8.62$.

As I mentioned previously, the $LL_n$ scales compute $x^{y/z}$ when $x > 1$, and the $LL_{0n}$ scale computes $x^{y/z}$ when $x < 1$. It is reasonable to ask, "If the $LL$ scale pairs can compute arbitrary powers and roots, why waste precious real estate with the redundant $A$, $B$, and $K$ scales?" The answer is convenience. Engineering calculations make frequent use of squares (for Pythagoreans and areas) and cubes (for volumes), and these scales provide quick calculations of those operations. And although the $LL$ scales are more powerful and precise, their procedures are commensurately more intricate and error prone.

***natural logarithmic scale***—The black $LL_n$ scale is derived from the base-$e$ ($e = 2.718$) natural logarithm $log_e$ or $ln$. The $LL_n$ and the $D$ scales are related by a bijective function $ln$:
$$
ln : LL_n \rightarrow D \\
ln^{-1} : D \rightarrow LL_n
$$
In the plot below, the black curve is $ln$ and the red is $ln^{-1}$.

![ln](./figures/SlideRules/plot-ln.jpg)

The special name for $ln^{-1}$ is $e^x$. The $LL_n$ and the $D$ scales form a transform pair that converts between the base-$e$ natural logarithmic scale and the base-$10$ common logarithmic scale.

Unlike other scales of the slide rule, the black $LL_n$ scale is not cyclic; it is one long scale. On the K&E 4081-3, the black $LL_n$ scale is divided into these three ranges:

- $LL_1$—$x ∈ [1.01 \rightarrow 1.105] \implies ln(x) ∈ [0.01, 0.1]$
- $LL_2$—$x ∈ [1.105 \rightarrow e] \implies ln(x) ∈ [0.1, 1.0]$
- $LL_3$—$x ∈ [e \rightarrow 22000] \implies ln(x) ∈ [1.0, 10.0]$, where $e = 2.718$ and $ln(e) = 1.0$

[$LL_n$ scales photo]

The function composition $log \circ ln$ used to construct the $LL_n$ scales makes the $LL_3$ scale line up perfectly with the $D$ scale: $log(ln(e_{LL_3})) = 0_D$ and $log(ln(22000_{LL_3})) = 1_D$. The $LL_n$ scales are a tangible example what "exponential growth" means: the first two 25-cm stretches of the scale span the range $[1.01, e]$, and the final 25-cm stretch span the range $[e, 22000]$.

But had the $log \circ log$ function composition been used to construct the $LL_n$ scales, the range of the $LL_3$ scale would be $[10^1, 10^{10}]$, instead. $e^x$ is famous for its fast growth rate, but $10^x$ beats it, hands down. Shrinking this galactic scale down to a 25-cm length would make the scale resolution unusably coarse.

The red $LL_{0n}$ scales are reciprocals of the black $LL_n$ scales. As such, the red scales run from right to left. On the K&E 4081-3, the red $LL_{0n}$ scale is divided into these ranges:

- $LL_{01}$—$x ∈ [0.9901 \leftarrow 0.905] \implies ln(x) ∈ [-0.01, -0.1]$
- $LL_{02}$—$x ∈ [0.905 \leftarrow 1/e] \implies ln(x) ∈ [-0.1, -1.0]$
- $LL_{03}$—$x ∈ [1/e \leftarrow 0.000045] \implies ln(x) ∈ [-1.0, -10.0]$, where $1/e = 0.368$

[$LL_{0n}$ scales photo]

Because the $LL$ scales are intimately linked to $ln$, and by extension to $e^x$, many slide rules label the $LL_n$ scales as $e^x$ and the $LL_{0n}$ scales as $e^{-x}$.

To compute $ln(2)$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:

- $LL_2$—Place the hairline on the *argument* $2$ on the $LL_2$ scale.
- $D$—Read under the hairline the *result* $693$ on the $D$ scale. As per the legend inscribed on the right side of the $LL_2$ scale, the value of $ln(2) ∈ [0.1, 1.0]$. Hence, we read $ln(2) = 0.693$.

To compute $ln(3)$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:

- $LL_3$—Place the hairline on the *argument* $3$ on the $LL_3$ scale.
- $D$—Read under the hairline the *result* $1099$ on the $D$ scale. As per the legend inscribed on the right side of the $LL_3$ scale, the value of $ln(3) ∈ [1.0, 10.0]$. Hence, we read $ln(3) = 1.099$.

Computing $e^x$, however, is not the primary purpose of the $LL$ scale pairs; [Peter Roget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Mark_Roget), of Roget Thesaurus fame, designed this scale to compute arbitrary powers and roots in the form of $x^{y/z}$. The black $LL_n$ scales are for computing powers and roots of $x > 1$, and the red $LL_{0n}$ for $x < 1$.

Using the $LL$ scales properly is challenging, and using them efficient requires an appreciable amount of practice. As we have seen above, multiplication and division start and end on the fixed $D$ scale and requires the use of the sliding the $C$ scale. Likewise, exponentiation starts and ends on the fixed $LL$ scale and requires the use of the sliding $C$ scale. The operation $x^y$ is performed on the slide rule in a similar manner as $y × x$ except, of course, using a different pair of scales.

To compute $1.03^{2.4}$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:

- $LL_1$—Place the hairline on the *base* $1.03$ on the $LL_1$ scale on the back side of the slide rule.
- $C$—Flip the slide rule to the front side. Slide the left-hand $1$ on the $C$ scale under the hairline.
- $C$—Place the hairline on the *exponent* $2.4$ on the $C$ scale.
- $LL_1$—Flip the slide rule to the back side. Read under the hairline the *result* $1.0735$ on the $LL_1$ scale. This computes $1.03^{2.4} = 1.0735$.

[$1.03^{2.4}$ photo]

But if we wish to compute $1.03^{9.2}$, we have a small crisis. Once the $C$ scale's left-hand $1$ is lined up with the $LL_1$ scale's $1.03$, the $C$ scale's $9.2$ has moved off the right edge of the slide rule. What this indicates is that we have exceeded the upper limit of the $LL_1$ scale, and have ventured into the $LL_2$ scale. To avoid going off the edge, we use the folded $CF$ scale, instead. We line up the $CF$ scale's $1$, which is near the centre of that scale, and move the hairline to the exponent $9.2$ of the left. We then read the result $1.03^{9.2} = 1.3125$ on the $LL_2$ scale.

[$1.03^{9.2}$ photo]

And if we wish to compute $1.03^{92}$, we would perform the same operations, but read the result $1.03^{92} = 15.2$ on the $LL_3$ scale.

At a glance, computing $x^y$ seems as simple as computing $x × y$. But in truth, the $LL$ scale is beguiling; a typical first-year engineering student takes a few months of regular use to become proficient in its use. The procedures computing $x^y$ are grouped into the following categories:

If $x > 1$, use the $LL_n$ scale.

- If $y ∈ [0.1, 1]$, the result is always less than the base, so read the result further down the scale, either to the left on the same scale or on the next lower scale.
- If $y ∈ [0.001, 0.1]$, reduce the problem to the $y ∈ [0.1, 1]$ case by mentally shifting the decimal point one or two places to the right.
- If $y ∈ [1, 10]$, the result is always greater than the base, so read the result further up the scale, either to the right on the same scale or on the next higher scale.
- If $y ∈ [10, 100]$, reduce the problem to the $y ∈ [1, 10]$ case by mentally shifting the decimal point one or two places to the left.
- If the result exceeds $22000$, factor out $10$ from the base or the exponent: $23^8 = 2.3^8 × 10^8$ or $1.9^{23} = 1.9^{10} × 1.9^{13}$.

If $x < 1$, use the $LL_{0n}$ scale. The procedures for the $LL_{0n}$ scales are similarly categorised into four ranges of the exponent. The $LL_{0n}$ scale comes in handy when dealing with negative exponents. Because $x^{-y} = 1/x^y$ and $LL_n = 1/LL_{0n}$, computing $x^y$ on the $LL_n$ scale but reading the result on the $LL_{0n}$ scale yields $y^{-y}$.

To compute $2.22^{-1.11}$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:

- $LL_2$—Place the hairline on the *base* $2.22$ on the $LL_2$ scale.
- $CI$—Slide the *exponent* $1.11$ on the $CI$ scale under the hairline.
- $CI$—Place the hairline on the right-hand $1$ of the $CI$ scale.
- $LL_{02}$—Read under the hairline the result $0.413$ on the $LL_{02}$ scale. This computes $2.22^{-1.11} = 0.413$.

[$2.22^{-1.11}$ photo]

If we had read the result on the $LL_2$ scale, we would have computed $2.22^{1.11} = 2.434$. But by reading the result on the $LL_{02}$ scale, we compute the reciprocal $1/2.434 = 0.413$, as required. The $LL$ scales are the most powerful scales on a typical engineering straight rule. But with that power comes numerous traps for the unweary. Interested readers may read the manuals listed in the resources section at the end of the article.

## *trigonometric*

Trigonometric functions are related to each other in the following ways:
$$
sin(\theta) = cos(90\degree - \theta) \\
cos(\theta) = sin(90\degree - \theta) \\
tan(\theta) = cot(90\degree - \theta) = \frac{sin(\theta)}{cos(\theta)} = \frac{1}{cot(\theta)} \\
cot(\theta) = tan(90\degree - \theta) = \frac{cos(\theta)}{sin(\theta)} = \frac{1}{tan(\theta)} \\
sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{cos(\theta)} \\
csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{sin(\theta)}
$$
In the plot below, the blue curve is $sin$, the green is $cos$, and the red is $tan$.

![sin-cos-tan](./figures/SlideRules/plot-sin-cos-tan.jpg)

***black $S$ scale***—The $S$ scale on the slide rule is graduated in degrees from $5.73\degree$ to $90\degree$. When $\theta ∈ [5.73\degree, 90\degree]$ on the $S$ scale, $sin(\theta) ∈ [0.1, 1.0]$ on the $C$ scale. The $S$ and the $C$ scales are related by a bijective function $sin$:
$$
sin: S \rightarrow C \\
sin^{-1}: C \rightarrow S
$$
In the plot below, the black curve is $sin$ and the blue is $sin^{-1}$. The inverse function, here $sin^{-1}$, is a reflection of the original function, here $sin$, in the $y = x$ line. The $x$-axis is the angle $\theta$ in radians.

![sin](./figures/SlideRules/plot-sin.jpg)

To compute $sin(30\degree)$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:

- $S$—Place the hairline on the *argument* $30\degree$ on the black $S$ scale.
- $C$—Read under the hairline the *result* $0.5$ on the $C$ scale. This computes $sin(30\degree) = 0.5$.

[$sin(30\degree)$ photo]

To compute $\theta$ in the expression $sin(\theta) = 0.866$, we do the opposite: set the argument $0.866$ on the $C$ scale and read $60\degree$ on the $S$ scale. This computes $\theta = sin^{-1}(0.866) = 60\degree$.

***red $S$ scale***—The $S$ scale is graduated in black for $sin$ between the angles $5.73\degree$ and $90\degree$. But since $cos(\theta) = sin(90\degree - \theta)$, the $cos$ scale is readily combined into the $S$ scale, but in the reverse direction and marked in red. Hence, $cos(\theta)$ is computed using the same procedure, but by referencing the red scale.

In the plot below, the red curve is $cos$ and the green is $cos^{-1}$.

![cos](./figures/SlideRules/plot-cos.jpg)

***black $T$ scale***—The $T$ scale is graduated in degrees from $5.73\degree$ to $45\degree$. When $\theta ∈ [5.73\degree, 45\degree]$ on the $T$ scale, $tan(\theta) ∈ [0.1, 1.0]$ on the $C$ scale. The $T$ and the $C$ scales are related by a bijective function $tan$:
$$
tan: T \rightarrow C \\
tan^{-1}: C \rightarrow S
$$
In the plot below, the black curve is $tan$ and the blue is $tan^{-1}$.

![tan](./figures/SlideRules/plot-tan.jpg)

***red $T$ scale***—The $T$ scale, too, has red markings, running right to left, for $\theta ∈ [45\degree, 84.29\degree]$. The red $T$ scale is used for $tan(\theta) ∈ [1 \rightarrow 10]$ and for $cot(\theta) ∈ [1.0 \leftarrow 0.1]$. The red $T$ scale is used in conjunction with the reciprocal $CI$ scale.

To compute $tan(83\degree)$, we manipulate the slide rule as follows:

- $T$—Place the hairline on the *argument* $83\degree$ on the red $T$ scale.
- $CI$—Read under the hairline the *result* 8.14 on the $CI$ scale. This computes $tan(83\degree) = 8.14$.

[$tan(83\degree)$ photo]

Since $cot(\theta) = tan(90\degree - \theta) = 1/tan(\theta)$, we may compute $cot(\theta)$ using the black and red $T$ scales, as mentioned above. So, to compute $cot(83\degree)$, we use the same procedure as $tan(83\degree)$ on the red $T$ scale, but instead read the result $cot(83\degree) = 1/tan(83\degree) = 0.1228$ on the $C$ scale. Alternatively, we may compute $tan(90\degree - 83\degree)$ on the black $T$ scale, and read the result $cot(83\degree) = tan(7\degree) = 0.1228$ on the $C$ scale.

In the plot below, the red curve is $cot$​ and the green is $cot^{-1}$​.

![cot](./figures/SlideRules/plot-cot.jpg)

***$ST$ or $SRT$ scale***—The $ST$ scale is used to compute $sin$ and $tan$ for small angles in the range $[0.573\degree, 5.73\degree]$, or in radians $[0.01, 0.1]$, because $sin(\theta) \approx tan(\theta)$ for small angles. For angles smaller than $0.573\degree$, we exploit another approximation: $sin(\theta) \approx tan(\theta) \approx \theta$, where the angle $\theta$ is measured in radians. For this reason, some manufacturers, like K&E, label the $ST$ scale as $SRT$ for $sin$-$rad$-$tan$.

In the plot below, the blue curve is $sin$ and the green is $tan$. These two curves are indistinguishable when $\theta ∈ [0.01, 0.1]$ radians.

It is possible to chain trigonometric and arithmetic calculations on the slide rule. This is one of the reasons why calculating with the slide rule is fast. Readers interested in these details should read the manuals listed in the resources section at the end of the article.

# MAINTENANCE

***calibration***—When an adjustable slide rule, like the K&E 4081-3, goes askew (but not warped), it can be recalibrated. The frame of this duplex slide rule consists of the fixed lower portion and the adjustable upper portion, and the two faces of the cursor are independently adjustable. Calibrate this slide rule as follows:

- ***align slide to lower frame***—Align the slide's $C$ scale with the lower frame's $D$ scale.
- ***align upper frame to slide***—Slightly loosen the screws that hold the upper frame. While keeping the slide aligned with the lower frame, align the upper frame's $DF$ scale to the slide's $CF$ scale. Retighten the screws, but not so tight as to impede the movement of the slide.
- ***align front cursor to frame***—Move the cursor hairline on the left-hand $π$ of the upper frame's $DF$ scale and the left-hand $1$ of the lower frame's $D$ scale on the front side of the frame. Slightly loosen the screws that hold the glass's metal frame to the top and the bottom end pieces of the cursor. Nudge the glass until the hairline is aligned to both the $DF$ and the $D$ scales. Retighten the glass frame screws. Do not over tighten, lest the cursor is damaged.
- ***align back cursor to frame***—Flip the slide rule, and align the back cursor to the frame in like manner.

Tedious and frustrating though it maybe, recalibrating the slide rule was the easy bit. Reading the scales with adequate precision, however, was not as easy, especially for those of us with poor eyesights.

***cleaning***—I can say nothing about maintaining vintage, Thacher-style large cylindrical rules, since I have never even seen one in person. But straight rules, circular rules, and Otis King-style cylindrical rules should be cleaned by gently wiping down with moistened paper towel, then wipe off the moisture, immediately. Although plastic and aluminium rules can be washed like dishes, wood and bamboo rules should not, lest they absorb too much moisture. Note that the black handle (the cursor) on the Otis King is actually black-painted brass cylinder. Aggressive rubbing will scrub off the black paint.

Sometimes, the slide can get a bit sticky. This is caused by the grime—a mixture of dust and skin oil—that collect in the contact areas between the slide and the frame. This grime can be scraped off with a moist paper towel. Do not apply lemon oil, grease, powder, graphite, or any other foreign material to the slide-frame contact areas.

Dust also tends to gather under the cursor glass. The easiest way to remove the dust is to use a compressed air canister to blow out the dust. To remove stubborn stains under the glass, however, the cursor may need to be disassembled and cleaned.

If you are reading this article, odds are that you have never used or owned a slide rule. It is my hope that you would acquire one, say from [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l2632&_nkw=slide+rules&_sacat=412), and learn to use it. Your first slide rule should not be a rare collector's item; it should be something like the [K&E 4081-3 Log Log Duplex Decitrig](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2047675.m570.l1313&_nkw=K%26E+4081-3+Log+Log+Duplex+Decitrig&_sacat=0) or the [Post 1460 Versalog](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&_nkw=Post+1460+Versalog&_sacat=0&LH_TitleDesc=0&_odkw=K%26E+4081-3+Log+Log+Duplex+Decitrig&_osacat=0)—a good, but cheap, workhorse. If you do end up buying one, your slide rule will most likely be grimy and discoloured, for having been kept in a dusty storage bin for decades. Do not despair; most old slide rules can be renewed to an extent. The grime and discolouration can be removed by gently—I mean gently—rubbing with the soft, foamy side of a moistened [kitchen sponge](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007C5IH4C?tag=aboutcom02thespruce-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1&ascsubtag=4164819%7Cnca170cbe1d384af0a2b09e62c4e4b9b020%7CB007C5IH4C) loaded with a spot of dish soap. If you do decide to attack a stain with the rough side of the sponge, use care and judgement, or you will scrub off the scale markings. And if yours is a wood slide rule, minimise the use of water as much as practicable. Dry off the slide rule after cleaning. I strongly suggest that you clean in stages, little by little.

# COLLECTING

This section is about collecting slide rules: what to look for, how to purchase, etc. I collect slide rules. This should surprise no one reading this article. But I am an atypical collector. I buy, but I do not sell, and I do not engage in bidding wars on eBay. And I collect only those slide rules that I coveted as a young engineering student in the early 1980s. More importantly, I collect only those slide rules that are not "collector-grade". The slide rules that I buy have high accuracy, but do not necessarily have high resale value: most are not rarities; some have former owners' names engraved upon them; many do not come with cases, manuals, wrappings, boxes, and other accoutrement of collecting. Moreover, I am partial to Darmstadt rules, for they offered the best balance in terms of density, simplicity, and utility.

My main goal in collecting slide rules is to play, not to display. Although these simple instruments no longer hold practical value today, they were once instrumental in humanity's ability to create societal value. I acknowledge that fact by collecting them. And by using them, I learn the ingenuity of my forebears, the engineers who designed these marvellous devices. Indeed, I taught my son how to use slide rules, when he was a third-grader. I am motivated by knowledge and nostalgia, not by possessory pride or pecuniary purpose. So, when perusing my collection described in this section, take my biases into consideration.

Below, I arranged my collection by slide rule varieties (straight, circular, and cylindrical) and, within each variety, by manufacturer names. Do note, though, that sellers (brands) were not necessarily the same as manufacturers, in some cases. For example, Frederick Post, a well-known American company, sold under the Post brand the bamboo slide rules manufactured by Hemmi in Japan. Hemmi also sold the same slide rules under their own brand. Also of note was that German manufacturers, Faber-Castell (est. 1761), Aristo (est. 1862), and Nestler (est. 1878), were in [West Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany) (FRD) during the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War), but Reiss (est. 1882) was in [East Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany) (DDR). Likewise, Kontrolpribor, a Russian manufacturer, is more properly labelled as a company from the former [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union).

***K&E 4083-3 Log Log Vector Duplex***—The K&E 4083-3 Log Log Vector Duplex was one of the earliest advanced engineering slide rules with $Sh$ hyperbolic sine and  $Th$ hyperbolic tangent scales. These vector rules were popular with mechanical and structural engineers, who use it to compute the [catenary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catenary) of chains (or, heavy-duty power transmission lines)—the sag that results when hanging a chain of a certain length from two equal-height posts.

![catenary](./figures/SlideRules/catenary.jpg)

The length and sag of a chain hung from two posts of equal height is expressed thus:
$$
l = 2 \frac{H}{w} sinh(\frac{wb}{H}) \\
s = \frac{H}{w} [cosh(\frac{wb}{H}) - 1]
$$
Here, $l$ is the length of the chain, $s$ is the sag, $w$ is the weight per unit length, $H$ is the tension at the lowest point, and $2b$ is the distance between the two posts suspending the chain. By the way, the world-famous [Gateway Arch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Arch) in St. Louis, MO, is a catenary arch, an inverted catenary curve.

Electrical power engineers (as opposed to electronic engineers) use hyperbolic functions to compute impedances (and hence, voltages and currents, by [Ohm's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law)) on long-distant power transmission lines that stretch several hundred kilometres. Electrical engineers model the impedance of a long transmission line using the [$π$ model](http://www.egr.unlv.edu/~eebag/TRANSMISSION%20LINES.pdf), which represents the long cable as a series connection of short, individual segments, like a long chain made of small, individual links. Electrical power engineering deals with electric motors, transmission lines, etc., and much of the work in this discipline involves [vector calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_calculus). The "vector" nomenclature of the K&E 4083-3 might well trace its origin to electrical power engineers' obsession with vector calculus and hyperbolic slide rules.

Catenary of chain and impedance of power line can be computed using the $C$, $D$, $CI$, $DI$, and other arithmetic scales in combination with $Sh$ and $Th$ hyperbolic scales on a vector slide rule, like the K&E 4083-3.

[K&E 4083-3 photo]

However, since [hyperbolic functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_functions) are related to exponential functions, an ordinary engineering slide rule, like the K&E 4081-3, can compute the hyperbolic functions using the following equations and the $LL$ scales, albeit rather tediously:
$$
sinh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2} \\
cosh(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2} \\
tanh(x) = \frac{sinh(x)}{cosh(x)} = \frac{e^{2x}-1}{e^{2x}+1} \\
coth(x) = \frac{cosh(x)}{sinh(x)} \\
sech(x) = \frac{1}{cosh(x)} \\
csch(x) = \frac{1}{sinh(x)}
$$

In the plot below, the blue curve is $sinh$, the green is $cosh$, and the red is $tanh$.

Incidentally, [Bernard Boykin](http://www.oughtred.org/memoriam/memoriam.shtml), the designer of the fabulous Boykin circular slide rule, was my fellow engineer and a fellow Marylander, to boot.

***Otis King Model L***—The Model L is identical in construction to the Model K, and these two models have a $D$ scale that is almost the same length. But the Model L's upper cylinder is occupied by the single-cycle $C$ scale and the $L$ scale. Where as the Model K could compute only $×$ and $÷$, the Model L could compute $×$, $÷$, $log$, $log^{-1}$, and $x^y$.

## *books*

- *[An Easy Introduction to the Slide Rule](https://archive.org/details/easyintroduction00isaa)*, Asimov
  - Everyone knows Isaac Asimov for his incisive science fiction novels, like *I, Robot*. But he also wrote numerous non-fiction works. This booklet is an equally incisive, down-to-earth explanation of how the Mannheim slide rule works. It was written for high school students of the day.
- *[The Slide Rule](https://archive.org/details/sliderule00john)*, Johnson
  - This book is the best slide rule instructional book for engineers. The author was a well-known engineering professor. Although this book applies to all engineering slide rules, the K&E 4081-3 is used for examples and photographs. Johnson's explanations of the $LL$ scales are particularly lucid.
- *[K&E Log Log Duplex Decitrig Slide Rule No. 4081 Manual](http://sliderule.ozmanor.com/man/man024-ke4081-02.html)*, Kells
  - The author was mathematics professor, and he wrote this manual for K&E. It is a definitive manual for the K&E 4081-3. Although the K&E 4081-3 does not have hyperbolic scales, this manual shows how to compute $sinh$, $cosh$, and $tanh$ using the $LL$ scales.

## *sites*

- [The Oughtred Society](http://oughtred.org/)
  - This is the most comprehensive site on slide rules. It was created by those who used the slide rule, professionally. They are an active, international lot. They have annual meetings. They publish detailed, insightful articles, both for beginners and experts.
- [International Slide Rule Museum](https://sliderulemuseum.com/SRM_Home.htm)
  - This site is a virtual museum of slide rules. There are very few slide rules, if any at all, that are absent from this collection. Every slide rule in the collection has a set of high-resolution photographs.
- [SlideRules.org](https://www.sliderules.org)
  - This site has slide rule simulators for many popular models.
- [K&E Slide Rule Manuals](http://mccoys-kecatalogs.com/KEManuals/manuals.htm)
  - This site has a long list of K&E slide rule manual PDFs.
- [Eric's Slide Rule Site](https://www.sliderule.ca/)
  - This is the site of an individual collector, so the collection is not as expansive. But it does have a decent background information on the slide rules that are in the collection.
- [Tina's Slide Rule Books and other Good Stuff](http://tinas-sliderules.me.uk/)
  - This is another collector's site. But this site covers other classic engineering tools, including drafting and scientific mechanical instruments. And it has a decent collection of PDFs.
- [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l2632&_nkw=slide+rules&_sacat=412)
  - There are loads of sites that cater to slide rule collectors. But these services tend to trade in the high-priced, collectors' market. If you want to buy an affordable slide rule that you can play around with, explore the American, British, French, German, and Japanese eBay sites. Remember, do not engage in a bidding war; that way lies headache and heartbreak.
