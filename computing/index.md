# Computing

This topic is devoted to computing. It covers computer science curriculum, career guide for computer scientists, programming languages, and the interactions between law and technology.

- [Computer Science Curriculum](CSCurriculum.md)
  - This article gives an overview of the computer science curriculum. It is aimed primarily at *parents* and *counsellors* advising a graduating high-schooler. The secondary audience is the *high-schooler* who is contemplating a career as a computer scientist.
- [Computer Science Career](CSCareer.md)
  - This article gives guidance on careers in computer science. The intended audience is computer science *undergraduate* and *graduate* students.
- [Programming Languages](ProgrammingLanguages.md)
  - This article provides a high-level view of the world of programming languages. It gives an overview of the history of programming languages; describes the declarative and imperative family lines; gives guidance on which languages to study, and what books to read; and explains the nature of programming as an activity. It is written for all STEM *practitioners*: mathematicians, engineers, scientists, programmers, system administrators, and technical managers.
- [How Computers Work](HowComputersWork.md)
  - This article explains to software developers how 8-bit computers are built from subsystems, how these subsystems collaborate to perform simple calculations, and how such simple calculations when combined exhibit complex behaviours. This information may make developers more mechanically sympathetic programmers.
- [Law and Technology](LawAndTechnology.md)
  - This article describes the interaction between law and technology. It covers topics such as regulatory compliance, intellectual property law, and contract law. The target audience is technical *leaders* and *managers*.
