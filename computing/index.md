This topic is devoted to computing. It covers computer science curriculum, career guide for computer scientists, programming languages, and the interactions between law and technology.

- [How Computers Work](HowComputersWork.md)
  - This article explains to software developers how 8-bit computers are built from subsystems, how these subsystems collaborate to perform simple calculations, and how such simple calculations when combined exhibit complex behaviours. This information may make *developers* more mechanically sympathetic programmers.
- [Computer Science Curriculum and Career](CS.md)
  - This section presents the computer science (CS) discipline from academic and industrial perspectives. The articles in this section are written for those planning to study CS, and in particular, those who are novice programmers.
- [Programming Languages and Paradigms](PL.md)
  - This section presents programming languages and their respective programming paradigms. The articles in this section are written for STEM practitioners who program, and especially, those who are experienced programmers.
- [Law and Technology](LawAndTechnology.md)
  - This article describes the interaction between law and technology. It covers topics such as regulatory compliance, intellectual property law, and contract law. The target audience is technical *leaders* and *managers*.
