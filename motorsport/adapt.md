## *adapting driving style to cope with handling problems*

Amen Zwa, Esq.

All race cars are sensitive to weather and track conditions, to varying extents. High-tech, high-strung race cars are especially sensitive to atmospheric conditions like temperature, pressure, moisture, wind direction, and so on, as well as to track temperature, proximity of opponents, and the like. And there is no such thing as a "perfect set-up". A car that handles well at the start of the race may well misbehave halfway into a race. As such, the driver must learn to cope with an ill-handling car. This section describes the driving techniques that can be used to ameliorate handling problems.
