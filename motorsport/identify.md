## *recognising car handling problems*

Race cars are like prescription spectacles. Just as the spectacles have to be custom made for the wearer, a race car must be custom fit the driver and the track for the prevailing weather conditions. Before a car can be set up, the driver must test drive it, and identify the handling problems. This section describes how to identify handling problems during testing.

## HANDLING

*Handing* is the on-track behaviour of the car as perceived by the driver. Drivers prefer a car that behaves predictably at each phase of driving: tracks the straights, feels stable during corner-entry braking, turns in crisply at corner entry, feels balanced mid corner, and oversteers slightly at corner exit. *Phases* of driving are travelling at full throttle along the straight, hard braking before the corner, trail braking at turn-in, neutral throttle at mid corner, initial acceleration at corner exit, and hard acceleration. Here, I present ways to analyse car handling problems that may arise during each phase of driving.

## *full throttle*

- wander—will not track straight line
- veer—over bumps

## *hard braking*

- dive—compresses front suspensions
- veer—under hard braking

## *trail braking*

- ???

## *neutral throttle*

- skid—skid away from apex
- understeer—understeer away from apex
- oversteer—oversteer into apex

## *initial acceleration*

- squat—squat onto rear suspensions
- understeer—understeer off the far edge
- oversteer—to an excess

## *hard acceleration*

- ????
