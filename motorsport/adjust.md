## *adjust car set-up to rectify handling problems*

Race cars are like prescription spectacles. Just as the spectacles have to be custom made for the wearer, a race car must be custom fitted to the driver and the track for the prevailing weather conditions. Before a car can be set up, the driver must test drive it in its factory set-up, and identify the handling problems, if any. This section describes how to identify handling problems during testing and how to rectify them upon returning to the pit. Drivers prefer a car that behaves predictably: follows the straights, feels stable during corner-entry braking, turns in crisply at corner entry, feels balanced mid corner, oversteers slightly at corner exit, and accelerates quickly along the subsequent straight.

The *driving phases* are defined as follows:

- Full throttle phase—travelling at full throttle along the straight
- Hard braking phase—braking hard before turning in for the corner
- Trail braking phase—continuing braking at turn-in
- Neutral throttle phase—remaining in neutral throttle at mid corner
- Initial acceleration phase—returning to throttle at corner exit
- Hard acceleration phase—resuming full throttle after having exited the corner

In each driving phase, specific issues may arise, either singly or multiply, under the following *handling categories*:

- Balance category—the car understeers or oversteers during cornering
- Compliance category—the tyres skip over bumps
- Manoeuvrability category—the car does not respond quickly to direction-change commands
- Responsiveness category—the car does not respond quickly to acceleration commands
- Stability category—the car does not track the straight line

In this section, I present ways to identify handling problems that may arise during each phase of driving, the symptom first, followed by a list of potential remedies. The remedies are listed in the order in which you should try. If the car you are driving does not have a particular set-up parameter, ignore it. When setting up an unfamiliar car, always establish the baseline lap time in the factory set-up. Never alter multiple parameters in one go; adjust only one set-up parameter by a small increment in only one direction, then test drive for a few laps. And note that many set-up parameters are intertwined, sometimes in unintended and unintuitive ways. Altering one parameter, for instance, may alleviate one kind of handling problem but simultaneously aggravate another kind of problem. And one parameter may affect multiple handling categories, or multiple parameters may affect one handling category. Careful analysis and disciplined approach are essential when setting up a car.

The goals of car set-up are as follows:

- Minimise the lap time—aim for the single best lap when setting up for qualifying, but when setting up for the race, aim for the lap times that are consistently good over many laps and are just slightly better than the competition
- Make the car handle well enough—it is impossible to make the car handle well in all phases of driving and in all corners on the track under all weather conditions, so just aim to minimise the car's assorted misbehaviours, everywhere on the track, as much as possible
- Maintain tyre operating temperatures—all four tyres should operate within their optimal ranges through much of the race, and each tyre's inner-middle-outer tread temperatures should be more or less equalised
- Minimise resource consumption—consumption rate of resources, like tyres, brakes, fuel, and driver stamina, should be reduced as much as possible, so that you can deploy the reserves at the end of the race when you pull ahead of the competition
