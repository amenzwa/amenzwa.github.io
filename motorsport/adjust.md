## *adjust car set-up to rectify handling problems*

Race cars are like prescription spectacles. Just as the spectacles have to be custom made for the wearer, a race car must be custom fitted to the driver and the track for the prevailing weather conditions. Before a car can be set up, the driver must test drive it, and identify the handling problems. This section describes how to identify handling problems during testing.

Drivers prefer a car that behaves predictably at each phase of driving: tracks the straights, feels stable during corner-entry braking, turns in crisply at corner entry, feels balanced mid corner, and oversteers slightly at corner exit. Phases of driving are as follows: travelling at full throttle along the straight, hard braking before the corner, trail braking at turn-in, neutral throttle at mid corner, initial acceleration at corner exit, and hard acceleration. Here, I present ways to identify car handling problems that may arise during each phase of driving, symptoms first, then potential causes and remedies listed in the order from more likely to less likely.

When setting up an unfamiliar car, always establish the baseline lap time in the factory set-up. Adjust one set-up parameter in one direction, and test drive. Patience and discipline matter. And let the lap time, tyre temperatures, handling, and longevity be your guides.

# FULL THROTTLE PHASE
