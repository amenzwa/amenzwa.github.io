## *adjust car set-up to rectify handling problems*

Race cars are like prescription spectacles. Just as the spectacles have to be custom made for the wearer, a race car must be custom fitted to the driver and the track for the prevailing weather conditions. Before a car can be set up, the driver must test drive it, and identify the handling problems. This section describes how to identify handling problems during testing. Drivers prefer a car that behaves predictably: follows the straights, feels stable during corner-entry braking, turns in crisply at corner entry, feels balanced mid corner, and oversteers slightly at corner exit.

The *driving phases* are defined as follows:

- Full throttle phase—travelling at full throttle along the straight
- Hard braking phase—braking hard before turning in for the corner
- Trail braking phase—continuing braking at turn-in
- Neutral throttle phase—remaining in neutral throttle at mid corner
- Initial acceleration phase—returning to throttle at corner exit
- Hard acceleration phase—resuming full throttle after having exited the corner

In each driving phase, issues related to the following *handling categories* may arise, either singly or in combination:

- Balance category—the car understeers or oversteers during cornering
- Compliance category—the tyres skip over bumps
- Manoeuvrability category—the car does not respond quickly to direction change commands
- Responsiveness category—the car does not respond quickly to acceleration commands
- Stability category—the car does not track straight line

Here, I present ways to identify handling problems that may arise during each phase of driving, symptoms first, then potential remedies listed in the order from more likely to less likely. If the car you are driving does not have a particular set-up parameter, ignore it. When setting up an unfamiliar car, always establish the baseline lap time in the factory set-up. Adjust one set-up parameter in one direction, and test drive. Patience and discipline matter. And let the lap time, tyre temperatures, handling comfort, and resource longevity be your guides.
