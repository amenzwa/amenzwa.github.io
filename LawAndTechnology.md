# INTRODUCTION

An engeer—like a doctor or a lawyer—is a licensed professional, who must possess both university degrees and a state license, in order to be allowed to practise in life-critical sectors, like building bridges and designing medical devices. So, engineering curricula offer electives on professional ethics and government regulations. But computer scientists—even those who work in heavily-regulated fields—are not licensed professionals. As such, no CS curriculum offers law-related electives. Yet, IT practitioners, too, interact with laws on a routine basis, directly or indirectly, knowingly or unknowingly:

- Every company is subject to corporate law, tax law, employment law, and many others.
- IT companies enter into contracts, as a matter of course in day-to-day running of their businesses.
- Every agreement is preceeded by a legal negotiations.
- Companies often sue their competitors for unfair competition, intellectual property theft, etc.
- In many sectors IT systems are required to comply with several regulations.
- Some regulations prohibit IT products from being exported to certain countries.
- All IT companies that innovate avail themselves of the intellectual property laws.
- Many small IT companies are bought out through mergers and acquisitions (M&A).

It is, therefore, recommended that CS students endeavour to gain a basic understanding of how the law impacts their work.

# SOURCES OF LAW

The [American Constitution](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/) established the federal government and the state governments as coequals, no one entity holding power over the others. This combined form of government is referred to as [federalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism_in_the_United_States). Few Americans today realise that the [Founders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States) intentionally granted limited powers—only those enumerated in the Constitution—to the federal government, so that the federal government does not subjugate the governments of the several states.

The Constitution also established three coequal branches within the federal government: the legislative branch under Article I makes the laws; the executive branch under Article II oversees the operations of those laws; and the judicial branch under Article III [say what the law is](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/5/137). This form of dividing governmental powers is known as [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers_under_the_United_States_Constitution). The legislative branch is headed by the Congress, which comprises two chambers, the [House of Representatives](https://www.house.gov/) representing the People, and the [Senate](https://www.senate.gov/) representing the States. The executive branch is headed by the [President](https://www.whitehouse.gov/) and his cabinet. The cabinet secretaries manage their respective executive departments. The judicial branch is headed by the [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/), under which lie the federal courts. State governments model themselves upon the federal, tripartite structure.

As it happens, all three federal branches make laws, albeit of different characters. A law made by Congress is called statutory law. A statute is an act of the People—an expression of their will. Statutory authority eminates from Article I. Statutes are codified into the [United States Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Code) (USC). A law made by the Executive, that is a department under him, is called regulatory law. A regulation comprises many individual rules. A Executive departments are deemed to possess the expertise required to fill in the technical, implementation details missing in statutes. The department's rule-making authority is expressly granted by Congress in the enabling statute that established it. Hence, the Executive's regulatory authority is not a constitutional power, but a statutory power. Regulations are cofided into the [Code of Federal Regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Federal_Regulations) (CFR). A law made by the Court is called common law (or case law). The Court's jurisdiction (authority to adjudicate cases arising under federal law) eminates from Article III. All Supreme Court decisions are published in the [United States Reports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Reports) (USR).

By Article VI Clause 2, the Constitution asserts itself [the supreme law of the land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause). The next level down are the statutes enacted by Congress. Below the statutes are the regulations promulgated by the Executive. The Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction (authority to adjudicate) over all federal laws and all matters related to the Constitution. In other words, the Court has the [exclusive authority to interpret the Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison), and it can strike down statutes and regulations that contravene constitutional provisions.

# REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

Regulatory compliance is a fact of life for IT practitioners, especially those who work in heavily regulated industries like transportation, financial, communications, and energy sectors. IT-related laws cover a vast array of issues: tax compliance, security compliance, privacy protection, handicap accessibility, export restriction, government contracts, etc. Most IT-related laws are named after specific statutes (Sarbanes–Oxley, FISMA, HIPAA, etc.) enacted by Congress. But the laws that actually govern the industry on a day-to-day basis are the rules in the regulations that were promulgated by the various departments, pursuant to those statutes. From it IT perspective, government regulations demand compliance reporting, and compliance reporting requires data aggregation. Penalty for non-compliance can be as benign as remediation orders to as severe as steep fines and even incarceration. In addition to federal regulations, state regulations may apply, too.

# INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW

Intellectual property (IP) comprises intangibles like trade secrets, trademarks, patents, and copyrights. Traditionally, trade secrets are protected by state law, but recently Congress extended [federal law protection to trade secrets](https://www.uspto.gov/ip-policy/trade-secret-policy). Trademarks are protected concurrently by federal and state governments. Copyrights are protected by state law before general publication, and alternatively by federal law after general publication. Patents are protected by federal law. In general, if an employee invents something on the job that could be a trade secret or patentable, that invention belongs to the company. Similarly, if an employee produces a written work on the job, the copyright in the work belongs to the company.

## *trade secrets*

[Trade secret](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/trade_secret) is some proprietary information—client list, formula, process, algorithm, recipe, etc.—that gives the owner an advantage over the competition and the owner takes due care to protect it against public disclosure. Legal protection extends as long as the owner maintains secrecy. If an employee or a licensee in possession of that information misappropriated it or unlawfully disclosed it, the owner can seek recompence in court. But the owner of a trade secret has no right to exclude others from making independent discoveries.

## *trademarks*

[Trademarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_trademark_law) are source-identifying marks—logo, name, sound, packaging shape, product shape, etc.—that, by their unique nature, inform consumers of the origin and quality of the product and, by extension, the company's reputation. A business becomes the owner of a trademark under state law, simply by using the mark on its products. But to secure federal law protection of its trademark, the business must register it with the [Patent and Trademark Office](https://www.uspto.gov/) (PTO). Trademark protection continues, as long as it remains in use. Hence, under trademark law, a company has cause of action against those who clone or imitate the look of their product. The owner, by faily to protect its trademark by timely suit, forfeits that protection.

## *patents*

American legal system favours free trade and detests monopolies. But the Constitution provides for [patents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_patent_law), which are temporary monopolies granted to inventors to profit from their new, useful, and non-obvious inventions. A typical patent term is 20 years. In applying for a patent with the PTO, the inventor must disclose the inner workings of his invention with sufficient details that would enable other practitioners to reproduce the invention. These temporary, exclusive rights entice creative people to invest substantial amounts of time, effort, and funds to create patentable inventions. When the patent term expires, the invention enters public domain, and it becomes available for anyone to use. This, in the long run, benefits society. In general, IT inventions relate to software-related designs and software-driven processes. [Apple v. Samsung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc._v._Samsung_Electronics_Co.) user interface design patent infringement cases are well-known among IT practitioners. To expedite the process of drafting patent applications, inventors should document (and date) their work in detail: design alternatives attempted, methods explored; versions of diagrams and drawings; results obtained, related ideas that maybe pursued later.

## *copyrights*

[Copyrights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_law_of_the_United_States) are exclusive rights that inheres in the authors of original writings and artworks. Author of programmes, both in compiled and source forms, obtains copyright simply by persisting the programmes to permanent media, with or without the copyright mark. Copyright protection extends to 70 years after the author's death. The [work made for hire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_for_hire) statutory exception grants copyright to employers for works created on the job by employees. Copyright protection of work made for hire may last up to 120 years from date of creation. These long-term are superfluous in IT, where technologies and methods quickly grow out of date, and are soon abandoned. The copyright protection that is relevant to IT is the protection against copying of proprietary programmes. But even this protection is losing its appeal, since software as a salable product paradigm have shifted almost entire to the paradigm of software as a web-borne service.

# CONTRACT LAW

Although IT practitioners interact with [contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_contract_law) only indirectly, this area of law is no less impactful: all externally-funded IT work is performed under some form of contract. Contracts are agreements formed under state law. The types of agreements relevant to IT are those that govern alliances, custom software development projects, IP licenses, and service deliveries.

## *aliances and collaborations*

An alliance is when a few companies agree to work together on a specific project for a limited stretch of time. One such high-profile project was the [Apple-IBM-Motorola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM_alliance) (AIM) alliance that created the PowerPC architecture. The alliance was formed in 1991, and PowerPC was a successful CPU in the mid 1990s. But by the late 1990s, Apple's relationship with AIM had turned sour. In 2006, Apple transitioned its hardware from PowerPC CPUs to the competing Intel CPUs. Full stop.

## *software development contracts*

A custom software development project is initiated when a company contracts with a software house to develop a custom software. Type of projects run under such contracts vary. At one end of the spectrum, the software house runs the project for a flat fee, and assumes the risk of failure. This is analogous to a kitchen remodelling project. This types of projects are rare because, in software projects, risk of loss is inherently undeterminable. At the other end of the spectrum, the software house provides expert development service on an hourly basis, and the hiring company runs the project and assumes the risk of failure. This is analogous to an on-demand maid service. This type of project is far more common in software development.

## *intellectual property licensing*

IP licensing is another topic of interest to IT practitioners. Sometimes, while creating a product a company discovers that a requisite component is covered by an existing patent, or that a high-quality, trade secret implementation is available. The company may then decide to acquire a license to use that technology. An IP license is a form of contract. IP licensing is non-existent in business computing, since line-of-business systems require no novel inventions. But this practice is common in specialised practice areas like medical devices, financial systems, and the like. On the other hand, [copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft) is familiar to all software practitioners. It is an open-source software license that grants others the right freely to use, modify, and distribute one's software on the condition that they preserve those same rights in their derivative works. Many versions of copyleft licenses vary in the extent to which the derivative work is deemed subject to the open-source license, and hence non-proprietary.

## *government contracts*

Perhaps the most important contracts to IT companies are those they make with the federal government, pursuant to the [Federal Acquisition Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Acquisition_Regulation) (FAR). The FAR prescribes the policies and procedures for the federal government's acquisition of products and services, including IT-related products and services. Not surprising, DC has the highest concentration of government contractors. These companies are pejoratively labelled "Beltway Bandits", in reference to the [Capital Beltway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Beltway) that surrounds DC. What distinguishes government contracts from private contracts is that many common law contract doctrines cannot be used to prevail upon the sovreign, and that the soverign always prefers lower price over higher quality. Common IT government contract types are fixed-price (FP), cost-plus (CP), time-and-materials (T&M), and indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity (IDIQ). An *FP contract* requires the contractor to complete the work at the negotiated price, thus allocating a high risk to the contractor. This type of contract is used to acquire hardware products or to run IT service programmes where the operating environments are stable and the contractors know the environment well. A *CP contract* reimburses the contractor for costs incurred during performance, up to the negotiated maximum price. This contract type gives the government the flexibility to ask the contractor to fill some urgent, unanticipated needs, without exposing undue risks to the contractor. A *T&M contract* pays the contractor for the time expended and the materials consumed to produce results. It offers greater flexibility to the government, and also allocates greater risk to the government. This type of contract is used for exploratory, research projects, where it is impossible to estimate the cost with any certainty, given the nature of the work. An *IDIQ contract* offers the government the greatest flexibility at the lowest cost. It allows the government th break up a large contract into small task orders, and when the need arises, asks multiple contractors compete for a task. This type of contract is suited for filling, on-demand, short-term needs for products and services.

# CONCLUSION

Although an average IT practitioner does not deal with the law directly, senior managers have the duty to ensure their company and their workforce comply with relevant laws. Indeed, many senior managers must partake in legal negotiations, some representing a division, others representing the entire company. Hence, it is beneficial for IT practitioners to familiarise themselves with at least the above-mentioned aspects of the law.
