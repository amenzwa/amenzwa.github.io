Although GNF is based on Kunos Simulazioniâ€™s [*Assetto Corsa*](https://www.assettocorsa.net/home-ac/) (AC) simulator, the principles, explanations, and suggestions given therein are applicable not only to all racing simulators but also to real-life track racing.  This *Car Set-up Guide* (CSG) is a companion to GNF.  While GNF is written in a conversational style suited to novice drivers learning AC, CSG is presented in a quick-reference style that enables a more experienced driver using any realistic simulator.  As such, this guide assumes that the driver is familiar with the fundamentals covered in GNF:  driving phases, corner configurations, handling techniques, on-track tactics, race strategies, and the like.  The main aim of CSG is to mitigate the frustrations stirred up by an ill-handling car, while learning a new track.

Modern, commercial racing simulators have attained the level of realism that is good enough for an amateur track racer to train at home, cheaply. Hence, the simulator should be configured to approximate his car and his local track. Regardless of driving experience, a driver is a temporary novice when learning a new track. So, he should drive a familiar, docile car with a good out-of-cockpit visibility, like the Mazda Miata, BMW E30 M3, or Lotus Type 25, when getting acquainted with a new track. And he should always use a real-life, laser-scanned, test track, like Suzuka, Mugello, Fiorano, etc., when learning the handling characteristics of an unfamiliar car. An intermediate driver may accumulate seat-time by starting every driving session with a short, warm-up stint (10 or so laps) in one simulator, one track, one weather, and one car, before moving on to fun antics. That same simulator-track-weather-car configuration is the home base for the driver, whatever his experience level.

This guide is divided into the following sections:

- [Identify](identify.md)
  - Recognise car handling problems and identifying their likely causes.
- [Tune](tune.md)
  - Adjust the car set-up in the pit to rectify the handling problems identified during testing.
- [Adapt](adapt.md)
  - Adapt one's driving style to ameliorate handling problems that erupt during a race.
