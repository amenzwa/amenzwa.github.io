# Tune

## adjusting car set-up for better handling

After completing a handful of test laps, bring the car back to the pit for tuning. In real life, the driver gives accurate, precise description of the car's on-track behaviour to the engineer, immediately upon his return to the pit. The engineer analyses the telemetry in the context of the driver's feedback, and formulates a set-up change. The mechanics then make the adjustments. Unlike a real-life race driver, the simulator driver is not in a position to distance himself from race car engineering matters. This section explains how various racing components alter the car's behaviour.
